//               true here rather than trusted.
//   Direct   -- our own UDP listen on net.port, bound on EVERY interface. Friends on the
//               same network reach it as-is; friends on the internet reach it if the
//               player forwards the port. When listed, the announce carries conn=direct +
//               the port, the master advertises the announce's source ip, and /v1/join
//               hands joiners "ip:port". When NOT listed, nothing leaves the machine at
//               all -- see IsMasterFree.

// The old third choice ("LAN ONLY") is GONE, not renamed: it was `Direct` + `!listed`

// already gives you; if it is forwarded, the player asked for reachability we then
// refused. The lobby password and the admission challenge are the controls, and they
// apply to every lane.

// re-read from the ini for a measured reason: the caller holds the exact string the
// player is looking at, and a round trip through `WriteIniValue` -> `ResolveString` can
// come back DIFFERENT (an unchecked write to a read-only ini, an env var that outranks
// the file, or a value with edge whitespace the ini parser trims). Any of those read back
