// ue_wrap/ufunction_hook.h -- patch a native UFunction's Func pointer (the
// standalone "UE4SS RegisterHook" technique) to catch a call our ProcessEvent
// detour can NEVER see.
//
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7): NO gameplay/network logic. Our only MinHook
// seam is UObject::ProcessEvent -- the OUTER entry to the BP-VM. A BP-internal call
// (EX_CallMath / EX_FinalFunction / EX_VirtualFunction / EX_Local*Function) routes
// UObject::CallFunction -> UFunction::Invoke -> (Context->*UFunction::Func)(Stack,
// Result), ONE LAYER BELOW the detour, and never re-enters ProcessEvent. So a
// ProcessEvent observer on such a callee registers but never fires (the chipPile
// grab + the clump re-pile spawn are exactly this -- EX_CallMath). To catch one we
// patch the callee UFunction's Func pointer (UFunction + off::UFunction_Func) with
// our own transparent forwarder.
//
// *** SCOPE, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING (corrected 2026-08-24, /qf rounds 34-35) ***
// The routes listed above funnel through `Func` ONLY WHEN THE CALLEE IS **NATIVE**.
// Both dispatch handlers branch on `FunctionFlags & 0x400 (FUNC_Native)` @UFunction+0xB0:
// a NATIVE callee goes UFunction::Invoke -> Func@+0xD8 (what we patch), while a
// **SCRIPT (BP-bytecode) callee goes ProcessScriptFunction -> ProcessInternal and NEVER
// READS Func AT ALL**. (Set-of-record correction 2026-09-02: "every patch is native" was
// a miscount -- SCRIPT overrides ARE patched too (puppet_spawn's BlueprintUpdateAnimation,
// save_indicator_suppress's saveAnim/addHint) and FIRE because their dispatch is
// ProcessEvent, whose Invoke also reads Func. The scope rule is about the DISPATCH ROUTE,
// not the callee list.) A Func patch on a BP function
// called via EX_Local* INSTALLS SUCCESSFULLY (Func = ProcessInternal, non-null, so it
// passes the null guard below), LOGS "patched", AND NEVER FIRES. A script UFunction
// called via EX_Local* is THE ONLY REMAINING INVISIBLE CLASS and is reachable today only
// via the 0x45 GNatives swap (ue_wrap/core/vm_dispatch.h) -- observe-only; a SECOND,
// cancel-capable closing technique (in-memory bytecode prologue gate, field-proven by
// Relay, ubergraphs excepted) is a CANDIDATE tier, not built: COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md
// row "SCRIPT UFunction via EX_Local*" addendum + the 2026-09-02 Relay study section 5.
// Authority: docs/COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md:88 (bold) + docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md:300-304
// ("Option E ELIMINATED BY MEASUREMENT"). A design cascade was built on the unqualified
// sentence and had to be reversed; see [[lesson-a-module-header-is-not-the-capability-map]].

//
// The forwarder reads FFrame::Object (the actor whose bytecode is executing = the
// SOURCE of a spawn issued from its ubergraph) BEFORE forwarding, forwards to the
// original Func (which steps the params from the bytecode stream + runs the impl +
// writes *Result), then reads *Result (the native fn's RESULT_PARAM out-value) and
// hands BOTH raw UObject*s to the gameplay callback. No engine layout leaks upward.
//
// THREADING: native UFunction dispatch (e.g. UWorld::SpawnActor) is GAME-THREAD only,
// so the callback runs on the game thread -- but DEEP inside an engine call, so it
// MUST be cheap and MUST NOT throw (the facility SEH-wraps it as a crash backstop, the
// same firewall contract as the ProcessEvent observers).
