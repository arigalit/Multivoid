<!--
  MAINTENANCE (single-owner rule, 2026-07-26):
  This file is the ONE owner of install/update/uninstall instructions. Every other
  surface (README quickstart, release-page Install blocks, the website Download
  section) links here and must NOT restate steps beyond one sentence.
  - NO per-build data: no build numbers, no hashes, no release-specific facts.
    Those live on the release page. CI enforces this (ledger_lint INSTALL checks:
    a literal multivoid-<target>-<digits>.dll or a 40/64-hex string fails the lint).
  - The ONE living version literal is the game target below; it changes only on a
    game retarget (see docs/VERSION_MIGRATION.md, "version identity" step).
  - The manual-lane mod-folder path and the upgrade-from-standalone rule are
    anchor phrases shared with the release-body template
    (tools/release/ledger_lib.ps1); the lint asserts they appear here verbatim.
    Reword them only together.
  - The dev-build/tester DISCLAIMER below is owned HERE too (user-approved
    2026-07-27). README and the website Download section carry a one-line
    pointer, never a copy. It deliberately names no build number or hash, so it
    stays lint-clean if a release body ever quotes it.

# Installing Multivoid

Multivoid is a co-op mod for **Voices of the Void**. It does not modify any
game files. It ships as **one zip** that every route below installs -- the
Thunderstore listing serves that same file -- and the mod runs as a
[UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) mod folder that is deleted to
uninstall.

## What you need

- **Voices of the Void 0.9.0n** (each mod build targets one game version; the
  release page and the in-game Multiplayer entry both show the pair).
- A mod manager -- [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/) or
  the Thunderstore Mod Manager. Every route below except the last one uses it,
  and it installs the loader for you.
- Nothing else, if you install from the Thunderstore listing. For the other two
  routes you also want the one `Pelmentor-Multivoid-<version>.zip` from the
  newest entry on the
  [Releases page](https://github.com/VOTV-MP/Multivoid/releases).

## Install from Thunderstore (recommended)

This is the way in. The manager installs the loader, keeps the mod updated, and
never touches your game folder by hand.

1. Install [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/) (or the
   Thunderstore Mod Manager) and select Voices of the Void.
2. Find **Multivoid** in the manager's browser and install it — or open the
   [listing](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Pelmentor/Multivoid/)
   and use its Install button, which hands the package to your manager.
3. Launch the game **through the manager**. It sets up the loader
   (unreal-shimloader + UE4SS) by itself; there is nothing else to configure.

## Install a downloaded zip through the manager

Same manager, same result, one extra step -- use this when you want a build that
is newer than the listing, since dev builds land on the Releases page first.

1. Download the one `Pelmentor-Multivoid-<version>.zip` from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/VOTV-MP/Multivoid/releases).
2. In r2modman, open **Settings** and click **Import local mod**, then pick the
   zip. (It is on the Settings screen itself -- there is a search box at the top
   if you do not spot it; type "import".)
3. Launch the game **through the manager**, as above.

You do not need a Thunderstore account for this, and the zip is the same file
the listing serves.

## Install by hand (LEAST PREFERRED)

Only if you keep your game folder entirely under your own control. It is listed
last for a reason: it is the only route where **you** install and maintain the
loader, and the manager route above takes the very same zip. If you are here
because you did not want a mod manager -- the import step above needs no account
and no listing, and it is shorter than what follows.

1. Install **UE4SS** into the game. Download the
   [unreal_shimloader package](https://thunderstore.io/c/voices-of-the-void/p/Thunderstore/unreal_shimloader/)
   and copy the contents of the `UE4SS\` folder **inside that zip** next to
   `VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe` (the game folder
   `WindowsNoEditor\VotV\Binaries\Win64`), so that `UE4SS.dll` and `dwmapi.dll`
   end up beside the executable.

   Copy only what is inside `UE4SS\`. The zip also has a `dwmapi.dll` at its
   top level -- that one belongs to the mod manager, and you do not want it.

   > **Why that download and not UE4SS's own release page (measured
   > 2026-08-31).** Two UE4SS builds are in circulation, and on Voices of the
   > Void they are not equally fast. The v3.0.1 release on GitHub was built in
   > February 2024; the build carried by the package above is from May 2026.
   > On one dev machine, changing nothing but `UE4SS.dll` took the in-game
   > frame rate from **70 to 118 fps**. That is a measurement on one machine,
   > not a promise about yours -- but it is why Multivoid pins the newer build,
   > and it is the same build the mod manager route above installs for you.
   > Details: `docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` section 9.
2. Unzip the Multivoid zip. Copy the **contents** of its `mod\` folder into
   `WindowsNoEditor\VotV\Binaries\Win64\Mods\Multivoid`
   inside your game install -- so that the file
   `...\Mods\Multivoid\dlls\main.dll` exists.
3. If the zip has a `pak\` folder (the player-model skins), copy its **contents**
   into `WindowsNoEditor\VotV\Content\Paks\LogicMods\multivoid`
   (create the folder if it does not exist). Without this step other players'
   scientist models fall back to the stock body on your screen.
4. Start the game. The main menu now has a **Multiplayer** entry showing the
   Multivoid version -- that is how you know the mod loaded.

## Upgrading from an old (pre-mod-folder) install

Older Multivoid builds were two DLLs sitting next to the game's executable.
The new build **refuses to start** beside them and shows a removal dialog, so
finish the upgrade first: delete the old `multivoid-*.dll` and `xinput1_3.dll`
from the folder that contains `VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe`, then install normally.

## Updating

- Mod manager: update (or re-import) the new zip; the manager replaces the old
  version.
- Manual: overwrite the `Mods\Multivoid` folder with the new zip's `mod\`
  contents.
- Host and joiners must run the **same build** — the game refuses a mismatched
  join with a popup telling you which side is older.

## Playing

- **Host**: Multiplayer menu → host. Your world and save are the session's
  single source of truth.
- **Join**: pick a lobby in the server browser, or connect directly by IP.

## Uninstall

- Mod manager: uninstall Multivoid in the manager.
- Manual: delete the `Mods\Multivoid` folder. The game boots completely stock
  without it (UE4SS may remain; it does nothing on its own).

For a full clean sweep, also delete the mod's runtime files next to the
executable (all optional — they only store mod settings and logs):
`multivoid.ini`, `multivoid.ini.example`, `multivoid.log`, `multivoid.prev.log`,
`multivoid-loaded.txt`, `multivoid-compat-report.txt`, `multivoid-players.txt`,
`multivoid-banlist.txt`, and the skin-pak folder
`VotV\Content\Paks\LogicMods\multivoid` if you created one.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Multivoid — old install found" dialog** — leftovers of a pre-mod-folder
  install are still next to the game's executable. Follow
  [Upgrading](#upgrading-from-an-old-pre-mod-folder-install).
- **"Multivoid is installed twice" dialog** — two copies of the mod folder are
  installed (for example one via the manager and one by hand). Remove one,
  restart the game.
- **Version-mismatch popup when joining** — host and client run different
  builds. Whoever is older updates (see [Updating](#updating)).
- **No Multiplayer entry in the main menu** — the mod did not load. Manager
  lane: make sure you launched through the manager. Manual lane: check that
  `...\Mods\Multivoid\dlls\main.dll` exists and that UE4SS is installed next to
  `VotV-Win64-Shipping.exe`.
- **Modded game refuses to start under the manager** — a leftover
  `xinput1_3.dll` next to the game's executable makes the manager's loader
  abort. Delete it (see [Upgrading](#upgrading-from-an-old-pre-mod-folder-install)).
