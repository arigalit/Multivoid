# Multivoid documentation

Multivoid adds co-op multiplayer to *Voices of the Void* — a single-player Unreal Engine 4.27 game —
**without modifying a single original game file**. These docs are the engineering record of how.

They are written by the people building it, so they are dense and they argue with themselves in
public: a claim is tagged with how it was established, and a doc that turned out wrong says so
instead of being quietly edited. Pick a lane below rather than reading top-to-bottom.

## I just want to play it

| | |
|---|---|
| **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** | Install, update, uninstall. The single owner of that prose — the README and every release body just link here |
| **[../SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)** | What the mod does and does not protect, and how to report a vulnerability. **Read the "what does not hold" part before hosting for strangers** |
| **[../README.md](../README.md)** | The project front page: what works today, field reports from testers, where to get builds |
| **[CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)** | The full credit ledger — every outside **code** contribution, **report** and **review** that changed the mod, what each turned out to be, and what shipped. The README and the site carry a one-line-per-person summary of this (renamed from `FIELD_REPORTS.md` on 2026-08-30, when contributors and testers merged into one list) |

Everything below this line is for people who want to know how it works. You do not need it to play.

## I want to understand it, or help

Start here, in this order:

| | |
|---|---|
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** | The shape of the mod in one read: the loader, the engine-wrapper layer, the co-op layer, and why they are separate |
| **[COOP_SCOPE.md](COOP_SCOPE.md)** | What is and is not replicated. This one is *law* — anything not listed is deliberately not synced |
| **[DEVS_GAUNTLET.md](DEVS_GAUNTLET.md)** | The VOTV developers' public statement on why multiplayer mods fail, kept verbatim. It is the bar this project builds to |
| **[FEASIBILITY.md](FEASIBILITY.md)** | Whether this is even possible, answered with measurements rather than optimism |
| **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** | Where it is going — the phased plan, with the dated decision entries that changed it |

Then, if you are going to touch code:

| | |
|---|---|
| **[RE_WORKFLOW.md](RE_WORKFLOW.md)** | How this project reverse-engineers the game: reflection first, then IDA, then UE4SS as a probe. None of those ship |
| **[AUTONOMOUS_TESTING.md](AUTONOMOUS_TESTING.md)** | The two-instance LAN harness — how a change gets smoke-tested without a human in the loop |
| **[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)** | How a build becomes a release, and the gates it must pass |
| **[THUNDERSTORE.md](THUNDERSTORE.md)** | How a release becomes a Thunderstore package: the manifest, the upload, and the rules that cannot be undone (a version is immutable; an author cannot delete a package) |
| **[VERSION_MIGRATION.md](VERSION_MIGRATION.md)** | What happens when VOTV updates: the measured version surface and the port runbook |
| **[MULTIPLAYER_UI.md](MULTIPLAYER_UI.md)** | The menus, the server browser, the master/signaling servers behind them |
| **[VOTV_UI_STYLE.md](VOTV_UI_STYLE.md)** | The game's own widget style, measured — binding for anything we draw in VOTV's UI |
| **[CROSS_SESSION.md](CROSS_SESSION.md)** | Two Claude sessions, one game rig: the lock and the working protocol |

**Before writing any entity-sync, hook or spawn-catch code, read these three first.** The first is
the whole method in one doc; the other two exist because not knowing them cost a three-iteration
rework and two review agents giving opposite answers:

- **[COOP_SYNC_DOCTRINE.md](COOP_SYNC_DOCTRINE.md)** — how a system gets synced here, distilled:
  foundation-first, authority table, the dispatch-seam ladder, brain parking, identity, the
  mandatory late-join row, and the forbidden-crutch list. Start every new lane from this.
- **[COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md](COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md)** — will my hook even fire? Visible vs
  invisible Blueprint dispatch, and the trap that `init()` is BP-internal.
- **[COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md](COOP_ENTITY_EXPRESSION_MAP.md)** — how each entity gets identity,
  expression and destruction, plus the duplication matrix.

**Left this repo**

[VotvIO](https://github.com/pelmentor/VotvIO) — the Blender addon that imports a VotV save into a
full scene. It grew here (`tools/blender/votvio/`, 28 commits, 2026-08-29 to 08-30) and moved to
its own repository on 2026-09-02 with its history and its arc doc. Nothing in Multivoid depends
on it; the lessons it taught stay in [LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md) §6.

**The ledger**

**[LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md)** — every hard-won lesson, categorized, each with a "look here first next
time" pointer. It is long on purpose: it exists so the same hole is not dug twice. If you are about
to spend a day on something, grep it first.

**[CRUTCHES.md](CRUTCHES.md)** — the standing register of subsystems we shipped in a crutch shape,
with the measured evidence and the proper fix for each. Created 2026-08-29 on user directive. It is
the counterpart to LESSONS.md: that one records what we learned, this one records what we still owe.

**[DEAD_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md](DEAD_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md)** — capabilities that are built,
documented, and never called. A build, a review and a doc comment prove a feature was *written*;
none proves it *runs*. Created 2026-09-02 after two such functions were found on one code path,
both live for three months — one made every server in the browser read `1/4`, the other made the
longest stage of a join report nothing. Carries the census instrument
(`tools/dead_api_census.py`), the fixed entries, and the ~12 still confirmed dead. Where
`CRUTCHES.md` records what we shipped in the wrong shape, this records what we shipped switched
off.

**[vehicles/](vehicles/README.md)** — the per-vehicle knowledge base, one doc per driveable
occupant-carrying multi-body actor. Same discipline as `items/` and `events/`: native behaviour from
the bytecode, the sync-axis table, and the honest as-built status live in that vehicle's own file.
Currently one entry, [vehicles/ATV.md](vehicles/ATV.md), whose §13 carries the runtime baseline that
`CRUTCHES.md` C1 rests on.

[OPUS_48_DISCIPLINE.md](OPUS_48_DISCIPLINE.md) — the working agreement for AI-assisted sessions on
this codebase. Multivoid is built by one maintainer with Claude, which the project states openly
rather than hides.

## How to read a claim in these docs

Status and evidence are tagged, and the tags are load-bearing:

| Tag | Means |
|---|---|
| `[V]` / **VERIFIED** | measured personally, with a citation — a log line, a disassembly, a file:line |
| `[RD]` | derived from reverse engineering, not directly observed running |
| `[A]` | reported by a read-only audit pass, **not** personally re-verified |
| `[?]` | unverified — a hypothesis wearing a claim's clothes |
| **DESIGN** vs **AS-BUILT** | what was planned vs what actually shipped. These drift, and the docs say when they did |

**Nothing is marked working on the strength of an automated smoke test alone** — that gets called a
smoke pass, and it says so. A doc that says "PROVEN" without naming its evidence is a bug in the doc.

Two conventions worth knowing: files ending in `-RE-<date>` are durable reverse-engineering records
and files ending in `-DESIGN-<date>` are point-in-time plans that are **deliberately never rewritten**
— read them as "what was believed that day", not as current instructions. Anything superseded moves
to an `_archive/` folder rather than being deleted, so an abandoned approach can never be mistaken
for the live one.

Some pointers in these docs lead to `research/`, `docs/security/`, `docs/DOCUMENTIZE_ARC.md`
or `.claude/skills/`. Those resolve in the maintainer's working tree and not on GitHub — all are
kept unpublished on purpose (the local-only docs-arc note says why). That is not a broken link.
The last two joined them on 2026-09-04: an internal session-close ritual and its working record
are addressed to the maintainer's tooling, not to a reader of this repo.
