# LESSONS — what VOTV_MP has learned the hard way

The single browsable ledger of durable lessons + **DIG-RULE** lessons. Each row is a takeaway, a
"look here FIRST next time" pointer where one applies, and a link to the full `memory/` file (the
authoritative detail). This complements — does not replace — `MEMORY.md` (the terse auto-memory index
loaded each session): `MEMORY.md` is the machine index; this is the human-readable, categorized digest.

**Maintained by `/documentize`** (Step 3.5): every sweep ADDS the session's new lessons and RECONCILES
existing rows for staleness (a row whose cited symbol/path moved is fixed or archived — a lesson pointing
at a dead symbol sends the next session on a worse dig than no lesson at all). A lesson earns a row only
if it saves a FUTURE dig.

> Links use the `memory/` slug: `memory/<slug>.md`.

## 0. The DIG-RULE (why this file exists)

**When a dig produces a hard-won measured fact, record it as a durable lesson so a future session reads it
instead of re-excavating the same hole.** Born because the project dug the same place twice (rock F2,
2026-07-08/09) and the user made it a rule. Two faces:

- **MAP-ALL-WIRE-EVENTS** — when a synced entity does not APPEAR / STICK / flickers / resets on a peer,
  MAP the full set of wire events ONE action emits (both peers, tick order) BEFORE building any fix; a
  later same-key event can silently UNDO an earlier one. `memory/feedback_map_all_wire_events_before_fixing_missing_sync.md`
- **PROBE-DON'T-GUESS** — MEASURE the root with a read-only probe before building a fix; a design stays
  provisional until the probe discriminates it. `memory/feedback_probe_dont_guess_rule.md`
- **VERIFY, don't re-derive** — recalled memory reflects what was true WHEN WRITTEN; verify a cited
  file/function/offset/flag still exists before recommending it (this is why staleness reconciliation is
  part of every sweep).

## 1. How to work (process / working agreements)

- **A RIVAL BINARY'S IMPORT TABLE IS A FREE CAPABILITY CENSUS — read it as a requirements map, not only as a fragility metric.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 (Relay pass 2): pefile + dbghelp demangle + group-by-owning-class turned Relay's 187 UE4SS.dll imports into 11 capability families and answered "what can it do that Multivoid cannot" EXHAUSTIVELY — 181/187 already owned engine-direct or not needed, exactly ONE lacked class (the FUObjectArray create/delete listeners, 6 imports), which became the pass-2 table-turner adoption (`docs/RELAY_ARC.md` WP-2, zero-import). The same table priced their fragility with numbers (46/187 dead on stable 3.0.1, 2/187 on experimental; one class rename kills every mangled import of that class). **Look here FIRST:** when a comparable closed mod appears, census its imports before anything else — per family ask owned / lacked / not-needed; the LACKED set is the roadmap-candidate list, each adopted engine-direct, never by import. Worked example: the study §12.4. [[lesson-a-rival-import-table-is-a-capability-census]]

- **CENSUS A PLATFORM'S CONSUMERS, NOT ITS API SURFACE — an advertised surface with zero consumers is a claim, and the vendor's own shipped content is the cheapest consumer census there is.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 (Relay pass 2): Relay's README leads with a mod-interop tag bus + a built-in `WorldReady` tag — a decompile census over its own 33 shipped BPs found ZERO bus consumers (`WorldReady` included); the one interop pattern actually used is a single named-service publish of the session handle; the flagship third-party adapter (SmartTV) declares no replication rule and no DLL support; Thunderstore shows 0 dependants, the watch-era library alone standing 19 months at 0. Weighting by README prominence would have adopted a bus nobody uses. **Look here FIRST:** for each advertised surface, grep/decompile the vendor's own examples + ecosystem dependants for CALLS to it; weight by consumer count. Sibling of [[lesson-a-capability-is-not-shipped-until-something-calls-it]], pointed at someone else's tree. [[lesson-census-a-platforms-consumers-not-its-api-surface]]

- **TWO COUNTS THAT AGREE ARE NOT ONE CENSUS — a numeric coincidence between different scopes/units invites a splice that survives review because both numbers are individually true.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 (the Relay study's own audit, finding M2): the canon census "136 call sites outside reflection.cpp, ~52 world-scoped" (SITES by resolved class, `world_identity.h:94-95`) vs a plain grep's "98 occurrences in 52 FILES" (different scope, different unit) — the study spliced them into one claim because the two 52s happen to be equal. Each number is individually true; only re-deriving both caught the join. **Look here FIRST:** every cited count carries its SCOPE + UNIT + INSTRUMENT inline; merge two counts only when all three match; when two independent counts agree suspiciously, treat the agreement as a trigger to check units, not as confirmation. [[lesson-two-counts-that-agree-are-not-one-census]]

- **A CAPABILITY IS NOT SHIPPED UNTIL SOMETHING CALLS IT — census the tree for declared-but-never-called API, because a build, a review and a doc comment are all evidence it was WRITTEN, none that it RUNS.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, two on ONE code path, both live for three months: `LobbyAnnouncer::SetPlayerCountFn` (born `8dd62916` 2026-06-07, `git log -S`/`-G` return that commit and nothing else) meant `lobby_announcer.cpp:118` took its `: 1` fallback on every heartbeat, so EVERY lobby in the server browser read `1/4` whoever was in it; and `save_transfer::GetProgress` — whose own comment says "Download progress for the loading screen (bytes)" — meant the longest stage of a real join rendered as an indeterminate "Connecting…" marquee. Neither broke a build, a test, or a join. The user predicted the second from the first (*"Some other things are probably fucked up in the same way"*) and was right. Same class as the 2026-08-23 `Registry::InvalidateLocal()` row. **Look here FIRST:** `python tools/dead_api_census.py` (138/2018 at HEAD `fff4032b`), then HAND-VALIDATE each hit — `grep -rn "\bNAME\b" --include=*.cpp --include=*.h src/votv-coop/{src,include}`; two refs = dead, three+ = it has a caller the scanner cannot see. Register + the still-open list: `docs/DEAD_CAPABILITY_REGISTER.md`. [[lesson-a-capability-is-not-shipped-until-something-calls-it]]

- **`git add -N` IS INVISIBLE TO THE INDEX GUARD AND COUNTED AS TRACKED BY EVERYTHING ELSE — three git questions, three inconsistent answers.** `[V]` 2026-09-03, scratch repo: for an intent-to-add path `git ls-files -- '*.md'` LISTS it (an index entry exists), `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` does NOT (not untracked), and `git diff --cached --name-only` is EMPTY (no content staged). `tools/docs/status_census.py` asked exactly those three, so a neighbour's brand-new never-reviewed doc was classified as an ordinary tracked doc: the `--new` publish gate could not fire and the index-reading cross-session guard saw nothing — a post-ship audit reproduced the close committing it and erasing the neighbour's marker. **Look here FIRST:** on a shared working tree enumerate intent-to-add separately — `git status --porcelain=v2` marks it `1 .A ` — before trusting either question; when two git commands disagree about a path it is in a half-state, so find the third that names it instead of believing the one your code already assumed. [[lesson-git-add-n-is-invisible-to-the-index-guard-but-listed-as-tracked]]
- **DRILL THE EMPTY AND THE NEGATED FORM OF EVERY VALUE A CHECK COMPARES — a wrong-but-well-formed fixture proves neither.** `[V]` 2026-09-03, one audit, two instruments that both HAD passing drills: `docs_census_gate`'s tiling check is `prev_close.startswith(base)` and `'abc123'.startswith('')` is True, so an EMPTY `base=` tiled onto any predecessor and passed without looking (its drill's tiling arm used a wrong-but-nonempty sha); and `status_grammar`'s label capture returned `('lead','FIXED')` for *"ROOT MEASURED, NOT FIXED"* — the opposite of the line's claim — because every fixture was a POSITIVE label and the four hand-written `NOT …` forms in the vocabulary made the gap look covered. The next real census carried 28 `NOT …` labels that had been recorded inverted. **Look here FIRST:** write a check's fixtures as a grid — empty, absent, negated, duplicated, wrong-but-well-formed — because an empty value is not wrong, it is absent, and it takes the same code path as a correct one; `startswith` / `in` / `search` over caller-supplied text are the three shapes where the empty case is silently true. [[lesson-drill-the-empty-and-negated-forms-of-every-value-a-check-compares]]
- **A TOLERANCE BRANCH KEYED ON A PATH THAT NEVER EXISTED IS NOT A FALLBACK, IT IS THE ONLY PATH — and a comment stating its premise is not a check of it.** `[V]` 2026-09-03: `tools/docs/lessons_gate.py` softens check A when the checkout is incomplete (a bare-basename citation that resolves nowhere becomes UNVERIFIABLE, not DEAD) — correct for CI, where `research/` is gitignored and `reference/` unfetched — and guarded by the comment *"with every root present this branch cannot be taken"*. But `CITE_ROOTS` listed `include`, a top-level directory this repo has NEVER had (`git log -- 'include/*'` = 0 commits; our headers are under `src/votv-coop/include/`), so `missing_roots` was non-empty on every machine, the branch fired on every run, and no dead bare-basename citation could fail the gate ANYWHERE from the branch's birth (2026-09-01) to its discovery. Found only because the drill's `dead file` arm was run for the first time since — `exit=0` where it must be 1. After the fix: `DEAD CITATIONS (1)` and the real ledger still PASSES (229 citations, 0 dead), so the hole was latent, not hiding rot. **Look here FIRST:** a skip/soften branch owes a PREMISE ASSERTION on the configuration where it must not fire — the drill now checks `absent_cite_roots() == []` before any arm — and every path constant is a claim about the tree: `ls` it or `git log -- '<path>'` it before trusting a list of directory names. [[lesson-a-tolerance-branch-keyed-on-a-path-that-never-existed-is-always-taken]]
- **AN INSTRUMENT'S SELF-TEST MUST ASSERT PRECISION AS WELL AS RECALL — "it found the known case" is half a gate.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, the dead-API census, twice in one hour: v1 could not find `SetPlayerCountFn` (a one-line inline header definition `void F() { … }` scored as a call) — blind to its own target, and its 147-name output was worthless. v2 found it, PASSED a recall-only self-test, and reported SIX LIVE `Tick*` functions as dead, because `subsystems.cpp:575-581` packs a scope guard, a walk timer and the call onto one line and that prefix scored as a return type. The false-positive half is the half that wastes a session chasing phantom defects, and recall alone cannot see it. **Look here FIRST:** every detector gets TWO canaries — a known-POSITIVE it must flag and a known-NEGATIVE it must not (`tools/dead_api_census.py` uses `ClientArmed` / `TickClientNpcs` and exits 1 if either fails); re-point a canary when its status legitimately changes, because a canary that has been fixed makes the gate fail forever and trains the reader to ignore it. Sibling of `[[lesson-an-instrument-blind-to-the-phenomenon-always-passes]]`, which covers only the recall half. [[lesson-a-self-test-must-assert-precision-not-only-recall]]

- **REPLACING AN INDETERMINATE PROGRESS INDICATOR WITH A DETERMINATE ONE MEANS OWNING EVERY STAGE IT NOW SPANS — a bar frozen at 100% is a STRONGER hang signal than the spinner it replaced.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, caught by a post-ship audit before it shipped: the first cut of the join-download fix gave the cover a real MB bar for the ~17 s transfer, and then nothing moved the phase off `Downloading` until the prop snapshot arrived — so the bar would have sat pegged at `17.6 / 17.6 MB` under "Downloading the host's world" for the 30-120 s world load that follows. That is the SAME perceived-hang defect the change existed to cure, relocated one stage later into a window 2-7x LONGER, and the marquee it replaced at least animated. Root: the state machine had three names for four real stages. **Look here FIRST:** when adding a determinate phase, enumerate what happens after its quantity saturates and before the next phase begins — if that gap has no name, the bar lives in it at 100%. Fix was a fourth phase (`LoadingWorld`, indeterminate), not a clamp. [[lesson-a-determinate-bar-must-own-every-stage-it-spans]]

- **A CLOSED BINARY'S LOG STRINGS DISCLOSE ITS DESIGN — census strings by channel prefix BEFORE decompiling.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 (the Relay comparative study): the entire mechanism of Relay's bytecode-gate subsystem — prologue injection, jump-offset relocation, restore-on-map-load, the ubergraph refusal WITH its reason, the marker function's name, the operator kill switches, the honest failure modes — was read out of the DLL's fmt strings (`[Relay/gate] ...`) in minutes, before the 474k-line Hex-Rays batch decompile finished; the PDB path disclosed the build workspace and the import table the substrate + crypto suite 1:1. A disciplined logger has written its own design doc into `.rdata`. **Look here FIRST:** dual-encoding strings dump → group by `[channel]` prefix → pefile imports/exports/PDB → THEN aim the decompiler at the two functions the strings name (`idat.exe -A -Ohexrays:out:ALL` runs headless when the IDA MCP is down; Hex-Rays 9.2 inlines wide strings at use sites, so grep the .c for the string text). Worked example: `research/findings/architecture-audits/votv-relay-vs-multivoid-STUDY-2026-09-02.md` §5/§11. [[lesson-a-closed-binarys-log-strings-disclose-its-design]]

- **A REJECTION RECORDED ON TOOLING GROUNDS EXPIRES WITH THE TOOLBOX — name the ground kind when rejecting, and re-visit tooling-grounded rejections when instruments land.** `[V]` 2026-09-02: the 2026-05-27 causeRain RE rejected in-memory bytecode patching with *"requires bytecode disassembly we don't have... Reject"* — a tooling ground that silently hardened into "we don't do bytecode patching" (three "uncancellable" statements in the tree). The disassembly toolchain landed 2026-09-02 (`bp_cpp/bp_cfg`), and the same day the Relay study field-proved the rejected class in production; nothing in our process had re-opened the branch. **Look here FIRST:** record every rejection with its ground kind (principle / measurement / tooling / cost); when a new instrument arrives, grep recorded rejections for the dependency it removes — `[[feedback-rebase-old-tool-facts-on-new-instruments]]` is the sibling rule for FACTS, this one is for DECISIONS. [[lesson-a-rejection-on-tooling-grounds-expires-with-the-toolbox]]

- **USER RULE 2026-09-02 — FOUNDATION-FIRST: when the requested sync of X turns out to rest on a base system Y whose own sync is absent/partial/wrong, STOP the X build and build Y properly first.** Verbatim: *«если я юзер предлагаю построить sync чего-то правильно, и после разбора выясняется что база правильная отсутствует на которой зиждится система, то сначала делаем базу правильно»*. The test: X would need a hold/retry register to tolerate Y's divergence. X's RE + converged design are PARKED with the dependency edge named, not discarded. All model tiers (OPUS_48 §2 carries it). Born: the laptop PC power lane (2026-09-02) parked on the power-chain base — power_sync mirrors only the panel PRESENTATION while every peer runs a private grid off its own `generatorFuckuper` dice. **Look here FIRST:** before designing any lane, ask which upstream value it holds still and whether THAT value has an owner (`docs/COOP_SYNC_MAP.md`'s gap list is the census); the parked lane's banner names the exact resume point. [[feedback-foundation-first-build-the-base-a-sync-rests-on]]

- **A PSEUDO-C++ LINEARIZER GARBLES FLOW-STACK BRANCHES — for control-flow-load-bearing facts read the `--offsets` listing, not the decompile.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 twice in one session: `generatorFuckuper`'s "loop-exit re-arm" and `ui_laptop`'s `@15/@604` double-branch were BOTH artifacts of BlueprintToCpp linearizing `EX_Push/PopExecutionFlow` into invented `if/goto` structure; Yangff's `--offsets` statement listing (explicit `$push`/`$pop` rows, every line offset-stamped) showed the real single flow in both. Data-flow facts survive linearization; BRANCH-SHAPE facts may not — the pseudo-C++ looks most authoritative exactly where it must invent. **Look here FIRST:** any "X runs only when Y"/"re-arms"/"unreachable" claim from `bp_cpp` output gets confirmed in `bp_cpp <BP> --offsets` or `bp_cfg`'s graph before becoming load-bearing; the offsets listing is the `[V]` instrument for control flow. [[lesson-pseudocpp-linearizer-garbles-flow-stack-branches]]

- **USER RULE 2026-09-02 — RE-BASE OLD BYTECODE FACTS ON THE NEW INSTRUMENTS WHEN RETURNING TO FIX.** Verbatim: *«если мы возвращаемся к фиксу вещей, база которых получена при помощи старых инструментов, мы если на то есть смысл - пробежались по базе при помощи новых инструментов»*. When a fix leans on a bytecode fact derived BEFORE 2026-09-02 (hand-walked `to-json` offsets, `_cfg.py`), run `tools/bp_cpp.py` (readable pseudo-C++, works on ATV/mainPlayer/mainGamemode; `--offsets` = the line-per-bytecode-offset listing) and/or `tools/bp_cfg.py` (CFG text + SVG) on the cited BPs and CONFIRM the load-bearing facts first — confirmed facts get `[V]` refreshed with the instrument named, refuted ones get a supersede-stamp. Scope = facts the change STANDS ON, never a blanket re-derivation. The wrappers are the legitimate first reach at EVERY model tier (OPUS_48_DISCIPLINE §2 carries the same rule); hand-walking raw JSON for a question they answer is now a process error. Same-day origin: the survey's own BlueprintToCpp SKIP stood on a README summary until the user's question forced the measurement that flipped it. [[feedback-rebase-old-tool-facts-on-new-instruments]]

- **A PINNED TOOL'S OTHER SUBCOMMANDS ARE CAPABILITY YOU ALREADY PAID FOR -- census the full command surface when you pin, or you will hand-reimplement a neighbouring subcommand.** `[V]` 2026-09-02: kismet-analyzer has been SHA-pinned in `tools/bp_reflect.py` since 2026-06, and every citation in this tree is `to-json`; the SAME exe carries `gen-cfg` -- per-function basic blocks, successor edges, CROSS-FUNCTION jump resolution (event stub -> ubergraph entry), and a graphviz emit -- and nobody ran it once. Instead the project hand-built `research/bp_reflection/_cfg.py`: a text CFG over the JSON with a hand-reimplemented EX_* size() engine whose EX_TextConst recursion had to be hand-validated against the header's ScriptBytecodeSize. The graph half went live in ~an hour as `tools/bp_cfg.py` and re-derived three measured facts on first render (ATV playerSit -> @9122 bare `EX_PopExecutionFlow` = ATV.md §15's dead stub; the BreakConstraint census rows; ui_damageIndicator @2292 `EX_Context -> dmg_full -> SetVisibility` = DEATH_ARC 11.3b's red-screen latch, byte-for-byte). One upstream bug found: an empty string operand emits `<FONT ...></FONT>` and graphviz's HTML grammar rejects empty elements, so KA's ORIGINAL .dot for ATV never rendered -- worked around in the slicer (`_fix_empty_font`). **Look here FIRST:** the moment you pin a third-party tool, run its bare `--help` and write the FULL subcommand list into the wrapper's docstring -- the survey that adopts a tool is also the census of what it can do; and before building any new bytecode/asset instrument, re-read that list. Survey + pins: `research/findings/tooling/votv-ue-modding-tools-survey-2026-09-02.md`. [[lesson-census-a-pinned-tools-full-command-surface]]

- **A TRACKED BUILD DIRECTORY KEEPS WHAT YOU DELETED -- and if it is also the deploy artifact, the retired file ships.** `[V]` 2026-09-02: the site's Open Graph card was replaced, `site/static/img/og-airlock.jpg` deleted, the template updated -- and `GET /img/og-airlock.jpg` still returned **HTTP 200**. Two facts compose, neither visible alone: `zola build` overwrites its output but does **not PRUNE** it (normal generator behaviour, logged nowhere), and `site/public/` is **tracked in the repo and is what `wrangler pages deploy public` uploads verbatim**. So a stale asset was one deploy from production. `rm -rf public && zola build` fixed it: `[V]` old URL **404**, new one 200, production matching. **Look here FIRST:** when you DELETE an asset from a generated site, ask what the deploy command takes as its argument -- if it is a directory, rebuild it from EMPTY rather than over itself, and verify with a **404 on the old URL** (a 200 on the new one proves nothing about the old). Grepping the source for references cannot find it: the stale copy has no reference, it is simply still there. Same shape as any overwrite-without-prune build cache (webpack, hugo, sphinx); the repo that COMMITS its output is where it bites. Second quirk of the same tool, same day: `zola serve` here does **not** rebuild on a template edit despite printing that it watches `templates` -- caught twice on a nav reorder; restart the server after every template edit rather than trusting live reload. [[lesson-a-tracked-build-directory-keeps-what-you-deleted]]

- **A GATE LEFT RED ON PURPOSE CARRIES NO SIGNAL -- it cannot tell "waiting" from "forgotten".** `[V]` 2026-09-02: on 08-31 the master's `COOP_LATEST_*` was set to a pre-release stand-in (`proto=134`) so the retired b133 cohort would see an update prompt, which made `verify_latest.ps1` fail; `docs/RELEASE.md` recorded it as *"FAILS BY DESIGN ... not a regression to investigate"*. Step 6 of the ritual was then **skipped at the b150 release**, and nothing caught it, because the only instrument that could have was already red and already excused -- both states produce identical output. `session_manager.cpp:377-380` prints the master's number verbatim, so every b150 install read `Multivoid 0.9.0n b150 (dev; latest released b134)` in the main-menu corner until **the user reported it**. `[V]` before: both legs served `{"mod":"Multivoid","proto":134}`; after the env fix + restart: `proto:150`, `verify_latest.ps1 -AllowDev` PASS. The gate was correct throughout -- it was disarmed by being EXPECTED to fail. **Look here FIRST:** never park a gate in a failing state to mean "not yet" -- pick a stand-in value that keeps it GREEN, or leave the knob unset until the real value exists. Before writing "X fails by design until step N", ask what fails if step N is skipped; if the answer is "nothing, X was already failing", the plan has no detector. And server-side release state (systemd `EnvironmentFile`, DNS) is invisible to CI, so it needs a gate that is green in the normal case. [[lesson-a-gate-left-red-on-purpose-carries-no-signal]]
 **Corollary 2026-09-02 (`DOCUMENTIZE_ARC` audit C-2):** a THRESHOLD gate on an existing debt is red by design for the whole pay-down; use a RATCHET -- red only on GROWTH against the previous recorded value -- and print the target: green on day one, red exactly when the mandate is violated, and no policy number needed to ship.
- **A DETECTOR IN THE EPILOGUE CANNOT PREVENT WHAT IT NAMES -- and a lock between automated sessions is invisible to the human whose box it is.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `mp.py`'s `kill_all()` stops EVERY `VotV-Win64-Shipping` on the box, not the ones the run launched, and every scenario begins with it. I started a smoke while the user was hands-on testing the release zip and killed their game. The instrument was not blind: `mp.py:344` computes `foreign = _SEEN_PIDS - _LAUNCHED_PIDS` and prints a five-line FOREIGN PROCESS WITNESS naming the exact PIDs -- **in the epilogue, describing the kill it had already performed**, addressed to whoever reads the log afterwards. At the DISPATCH point the same question is free and exact rather than merely earlier: the run has launched nothing, so every live VotV process is by construction not ours -- no subtraction, no sampling window. `tools/game_lock.py` did not cover it and could not: it answers *"does another SESSION hold the rig"*, and a person takes no lock. Fixed by refusing (`exit 3`) before the kill, with `kill` and an already-held persistent lock exempt and `MULTIVOID_RIG_TAKEOVER=1` as the override (`185925f4`). **Look here FIRST:** when a check names a hazard, ask what it can still PREVENT where it runs -- if the answer is nothing it is a post-mortem, not a guard. A destructive default (kill-all / delete-all / reset-all) deserves a pre-flight refusal, because the cost is asymmetric: a needless refusal costs one `mp.py kill`, a needless kill destroys evidence nobody can recover. And read each input to a new refusal's branch BEFORE running it live, or the demonstration is another chance to do the damage. [[lesson-a-detector-in-the-epilogue-cannot-prevent-what-it-names]]

- **PUT THE GATE WHERE THE EXACT NUMBER ALREADY IS -- a guess at the consumer loses to a fact the producer already logs.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: I gated a bad world blob at the CONSUMER on a byte-size ratio against the host's canonical save. A post-ship audit showed it **could not fire on the incident it was written for** -- a fresh VOTV save is ~1,248 B, so `1284 * 8 < 1248` is false and the stub ships anyway; every case the fix "proved" was a big canonical against a big capture, the opposite of the failing one. Meanwhile the PRODUCER, one line from the defect, was already printing `objectsData repopulated 3385 -> 3397` -- and the stub would have read `0 -> 0`. The gate moved there; the ratio is kept only as a demoted second opinion with its false mechanism retracted. **Look here FIRST:** before writing a plausibility check, grep the producer for a number it already computes -- an existing log line whose value differs between a healthy and a broken run IS the check, already written. Symptom site and defect site are usually different modules, and the gate belongs at the defect. And a gate you cannot demonstrate FIRING is not evidence: mine passed a smoke by not firing on a good world, which proves nothing about a bad one. [[lesson-put-the-gate-where-the-exact-number-already-is]]

- **A REFACTOR CAN DELETE A CROSS-MODULE PUBLISH AND LEAVE THE SUBSYSTEM BEHIND ITS GATE DARK -- and `git log -S` IS BLIND TO IT.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `ReseedGatePasses_` reads `g_reaperInGameplay`, whose only writer is `SetReaperInGameplayWorld`. The call was WRITTEN on 2026-08-23 (`e1b1639f`), **deleted 2026-08-25 by `3f357ecd` -- itself an audit-fold commit** -- and restored 2026-09-01 (`40c0e086`). The same hunk that removed the call ADDED a comment naming the symbol, so the occurrence count went 1 -> 1 and `-S` reports only two commits; `-G` shows all three. I used `-S`, concluded "declared, defined and NEVER called", and wrote that into a commit message, a design-doc correction, this row and the memory file -- all four wrong, corrected by the post-ship audit. What held either way: seven dark days in which consumer #14 collected ~3,200 candidates every two seconds and adjudicated none (~90,000 dropped per minute in stored runs), the host key index sat at 28 keyed props against a world of ~2,200 -- hence every coin-gun sale of a save-loaded prop refused with the item already destroyed -- and `SeedGeneration()` was frozen. What did NOT hold: the R-2b acceptance DID run with the gate open, so its numbers are real. **Look here FIRST:** when an effect is missing, grep the gate WRITER for callers; when you then ask when it changed, use `git log -G`, never `-S` (it answers "did the count change", which is not the question). An audit-fold commit rewriting a comment block is a deletion risk for the code inside it. And check the acceptance gate can fail for the right reason -- this one could not: its timer is constructed after its own early return, and its RED lever lives inside the branch it calibrates. [[lesson-a-setter-with-no-callers-disables-what-it-gates]]

- **A DEV DEPLOY THAT STAGES DIFFERENT BYTES THAN THE RELEASE CANNOT REPRODUCE A PLAYER -- and it will confound the investigation it is inside of.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `deploy-all.ps1` staged `research\pak_re\hl_einstein_v1sc.pak`, retired from the shipped set on 2026-08-29, and never staged `scientists.pak`, which is what the release actually packages (read from inside the zip). Every dev rig carried a skin no player has and lacked the one every player has -- and because the deploy copied without pruning, the retired pak had been mounted since 2026-07-02. A fallback skin then resolved on the rigs ONLY because the deploy kept putting it back, during the run measuring why it did not resolve for the user. The user found it before I did. **Look here FIRST:** when a reported bug will not reproduce, or reproduces for the wrong reason, diff what the RIG carries against what the RELEASE packages before doubting the report -- two `ls` commands. A deploy must MIRROR its source (copy what ships, prune what does not, scoped to a directory the tool owns); a path under `research/` inside a deploy script is a smell by itself.

- **AN EXCEPTION LIST MUST ASSERT THE BRANCH, NOT THE NAME -- and a drill you wrote in the same hour will certify the strawman.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: the allowlist in my new `reliablekind_gate.py` let five kinds have no receiver because the net thread eats them, and verified that by asking whether the named file still MENTIONED each kind. A post-ship audit deleted all three real interceptions, one at a time, and the gate returned **PASS every time** -- both files name those kinds in unrelated places (lane sizing in `session.cpp`; the outgoing sends in `peer_admission.cpp` -- deliberately cited without line numbers: a concurrent session was extracting that file the same hour, and a citation that rots on someone else's refactor blocks THEIR commit for MY row), so presence could not possibly discriminate. My own negative control hid it: it did a GLOBAL replace of every `ReliableKind::AuthProof` token, a mutation no real edit produces, so it tested my regex rather than my invariant. **Look here FIRST:** write the drill's mutation as THE EDIT A HUMAN WOULD MAKE (delete the branch); make an allowlist entry name the SHAPE of its claim (`== ReliableKind::X ) {`, or the predicate call and its `return;`); and before trusting a presence check, grep the token in the named file to see what ELSE says it. The gate's own commit message is a testable claim -- mine advertised "delete that interception and the gate fails" and nobody had deleted one.

- **SEND-SIDE EVIDENCE IS NOT DELIVERY EVIDENCE -- and four green facts can all be about the wrong thing.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: I published a new sync lane as "live cross-peer" and two post-ship audits found it had never reached a receiver -- the new `ReliableKind` was missing from its family switch, so `event_feed` logged `unknown ReliableKind 129 -- dropping` per packet. Everything I had cited was real and none of it was delivery: *"connect-snapshot sent 42 states"* is the SENDER; the identical index `keysHash` is both peers' LOCAL scans; *"census: 0 disagreements"* was taken at idle, where there is nothing to disagree about; and the selftest called the apply function DIRECTLY, bypassing the wire. **Look here FIRST:** for any wire lane the acceptance line lives in the RECEIVER's log and names the sender (`<lane>: applied ... (from slot N)`) -- if you cannot name that line, the lane is untested; the negative control is one grep for `unknown ReliableKind <N>` on both peers; and a direct-call selftest proves the APPLY, never the ROUTE. This is the third shipment of that class after v70 `DeskLogLine` and v71 `SleepState`, so the memo checklist was not enough. **The owed machine gate is now BUILT and in CI per push -- `tools/net/reliablekind_gate.py`, `cc69dafe` 2026-09-01** (its negative control is real history: run against `96d14250` it fails and names `LightGroupState = 129`; against `7fed1c1a` it passes). Correcting the number this row used to imply: receiver coverage is 100 family + 17 event_feed = **117 of 122**, and only **5** kinds legitimately have no receiver, not the 22 first measured -- that figure forgot event_feed's own switch. The runtime half rides `mp.py smoke`, which now exits 11 on `unknown ReliableKind` on any peer. [[lesson-send-side-evidence-is-not-delivery-evidence]]

- **A MUTATING DEV PROBE BREAKS THE RUN IT MEASURES -- and BOTH of the first answers were wrong (row CORRECTED 2026-09-01, same day it was written).** `[V]` arming `lightswitch_probe` on the host cost the client its join (`expected 2 peers, got 1` with the flag on, `PASS` with it off, same DLL, twice). The durable half is the DE-BRAIDING: that failure string is this project's signature for a CONCURRENT SESSION killing your run, so the cheap explanation was a rig collision and it was wrong -- `_FRIENDLY_SESSION.txt` is what ruled it out BEFORE a re-run. **What this row used to prescribe -- "gate on `running() || connected()`" -- produces code that CAN NEVER RUN**, because the only path to that Tick is `net_pump::Tick`, which the harness calls only when `running()` is true ([[lesson-a-guard-can-be-unsatisfiable-with-its-own-caller]]); and the mechanism it asserted ("a host that has not yet accepted a client is not connected, and that IS the window") is contradicted by the timing -- the one-shot fired at 16:01:19 and the peer was accepted into PENDING at 16:01:20, i.e. the peer is ARRIVING and is invisible to both predicates. **Look here FIRST:** gate on peers present OR arriving (`connectedPeerCount() + pendingPeerCount() > 0`) and LATCH it for the process, or a host whose only client leaves drops back to zero and fires into a live session; disarm the flag with a VALUE, not a `pop` ([[lesson-popping-an-env-var-does-not-disarm-a-layered-flag]]); keep read-only and mutating instruments on SEPARATE ini rows; and de-braid a two-peer failure by re-running with one flag flipped and nothing else. The working configuration is a SOLO HOST WITH A LIVE SESSION (`mp.py lightgroup`), not a session-less launch -- that branch calls `subsystems::Install` and nothing else. [[lesson-a-mutating-probe-breaks-the-run-it-measures]]

- **A gate that grades ONE of N steps straight over the others -- and the loop being complete does
  not make the verdict complete.** `[V]` found by a post-ship audit 2026-09-01, in the gate written
  that same hour to prove the rejoin-crash fix. The census walked every `UWorld` but kept
  `deadWorld = w` (the LAST dead one) and the harness failed on that one's holder count. Reload
  churn's whole purpose is to produce more than one dead world, so a root-set object anchoring the
  OTHER one reported `(0 of them RootSet)` and `ALL PASS` -- a gate able to certify the exact defect
  it was built for. Nothing about it reads wrong: the iteration is exhaustive, the name is right,
  the count is real; the set was collapsed to a representative BETWEEN the walk and the verdict.
  *Look FIRST:* when a verdict reads one value out of a loop over N things, ask what N is in the
  scenario's WORST case (here typical 1, designed 2); grade on the MAX across the set and print one
  line per member. And ask the question a must-fire drill cannot answer -- "could this gate PASS
  while the defect is present?" -- separately from "did it fire when I injected one".

- **A UE4 minidump resolves to named functions from the shipped exe alone -- no IDA, no IDB.**
  `[V]` 2026-08-31. `CrashContext.runtime-xml` has an empty `<CallStack>` but a populated
  `<PCallStack>` of `module + offset`. Three steps in Python: the PE exception directory
  (`.pdata`, **253,744** `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` entries in this exe) bisects an RVA to exact function
  bounds with no analysis pass; `capstone` + the `lea reg,[rip+d]` string references NAME the
  function (`"Invalid URL: {0}"` is `UEngine::Browse`, `"Couldn't spawn player: %s"` is
  `UEngine::LoadMap`, `"GAME=" + "LoadForAllGameModes"` is `CreateGameModeForURL`); and the SDK
  CXXHeaderDump confirms the offsets the faulting instruction touches. The frame after
  `ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatch` is the faulting IP ITSELF, not a return address. Also: `
  <PCallStackHash>` is how you prove a reproduced crash is THE SAME crash. *Look FIRST:* read the
  crash report before writing a repro, and reach for this before the IDA rung -- building an IDB
  for a 300 MB shipping exe costs more than the whole analysis did. Scripts:
  `<scratchpad>/crash/{pdata,fstr,win}.py`. (Trap: naming the helper `dis.py` shadows stdlib `dis`
  and the failure reads as a capstone import bug.)
  [[lesson-a-minidump-resolves-without-an-idb]]

- **Sample a repeated pattern in TWO places before attributing it to an object.** `[V]` 2026-08-31,
  the browser frame. The native window's left edge at y=500 shows the border band-pair TWICE, and
  that was read as "this box wears two rings" -- a second ring shipped. The SAME edge at y=208,
  where no inner panel sits, shows it ONCE: the second pair was the nested LIST panel's ring, so the
  ladder is NESTING and the fix was an inset, not a doubled border. The wrong reading also broke
  every server row (it made the box four children wide while `server_browser_rows` read parts by
  index, and `UPanelWidget::Slots` / `UImage::Brush` share offset 0x108). A single scanline is the
  SUM of a widget stack and says nothing about which object owns which pixel; only how the pattern
  VARIES does. *Look FIRST:* when a measured constant moves into code, restate WHAT DISTANCE it
  measures in the same sentence -- the 4 px here was right all along and was spent on the wrong gap.
  [[lesson-sample-a-repeated-pattern-at-two-places-before-attributing-it]]

- **A `false` return can mean DEFERRED -- score a scenario on the EVENT, not the bool.** `[V]`
  2026-08-31: `engine::LoadStorySave` returns false when called at the menu, then registers the save
  and re-issues `open untitled_1`, which lands a second later. The probe logged `dispatched=0` while
  the log below it showed the world changing. Its header ("returns false if the slot is missing or
  load can't dispatch") is true and not exhaustive. *Look FIRST:* read the function's OWN log lines
  for one run before scoring on its return value, and prefer a term the caller can observe
  independently -- a world pointer that changed, `world_identity::Generation()`, a file that
  appeared. [[lesson-a-false-return-can-mean-deferred-score-on-the-event]]

- **DO NOT PRICE A THIRD PARTY'S COST ON THE USER'S BEHALF -- AND WITHHOLDING IS AN ACTION.** 2026-08-31, the VPS cutover. The master + relay were two arcs behind, A59 was fixed in source and wide open in production, the replacement binaries were built and gated, and only `systemctl restart` was left. I did not run it: the restart retires the b<=133 cohort, three real lobbies were live, and the newest published release *was* b133 -- so it would have told real players *"update Multivoid"* and named an update that did not exist. Sound reasoning, and **not mine to settle.** I wrote it into `docs/RELEASE.md` as a section, derived a 9-step release-day ordering from it (rebuild at 4, restart at 6, gate at 7), added a subsection defending the deviation from the ritual's own redeploy-then-publish rule, and wrote the user's r2modman test a workaround so it could reach a session *around* the stale server (point at the staged pair, `ufw allow 10010/tcp`, remember to delete the rules). The user's reply was one clause: **"плевать на когорту."** All of it was deleted within the hour; the cutover took twenty minutes. **The tell is checkable: my design's complexity existed entirely to avoid imposing a cost on someone who was not in the conversation** -- not a correctness requirement, a courtesy, and courtesies are product decisions. It is the mirror of [[feedback-a-met-precondition-is-not-the-decision-it-gates]] from the same session (there I *acted* on an inferred green light; here I *withheld* on an inferred red one), and the harder half to notice, because withholding produces a document full of careful reasoning instead of a visible action. **Look here FIRST:** ask who the cost falls on -- if the answer is "players" or "a third party" rather than "the codebase", it is a product call, and one line to the user beats a well-reasoned section. A runbook section that exists to SEQUENCE AROUND a problem is the tell (RULE 1's shape, applied to ops: if you are writing ordering rules, staging recipes or firewall dances so something need not be fixed yet, ask whether it should just be fixed). And weigh the asymmetry: twenty minutes of work, against three doc sections and a workaround with a cleanup step, spent avoiding it. [[lesson-do-not-price-a-third-partys-cost-on-the-users-behalf]]
- **A LOW-ENTROPY SECRET MUST NEVER ENTER A SIGNATURE THE OTHER SIDE CAN VERIFY OFFLINE.** 2026-08-31, the A2 lobby-password design pass killed its own mechanism. Mixing `KDF(password)` into the 126-byte blob the client already signs looked ideal -- zero wire bytes, no proto bump, and it inherits the nonce binding so a captured proof cannot be REPLAYED. Replay was never the threat: the party that RECEIVES the proof knows every other term (both pubkeys, the nonce IT chose, the constants, and the layout is in a public repo) and Ed25519 verification is PUBLIC, so it rebuilds the blob per candidate and grinds the password OFFLINE at hardware speed -- the master's `RL_JOIN` 20/min is irrelevant to it. Folding it into the HOST's signature only reverses the victim; the "verify against the empty-password form too" trick dies on the same oracle. "A captured proof is useless" was TRUE about replay and was silently doing duty as a claim about CONFIDENTIALITY. **Look here FIRST:** before putting a secret in a signed or hashed blob, ask who can VERIFY it and what else they know; if the verifier knows every other term you have built an offline oracle no rate limit can bound. The way out is BINDING (authenticate the recipient first, out-of-band), not entropy. [[lesson-a-low-entropy-secret-must-not-enter-a-signature-blob]]
- **A BOUND AT ONE LANE IS NOT A BOUND -- CENSUS THE ROUTES, NOT THE ENDPOINT.** 2026-08-31: "the master already rate-limits password guessing" was measured true (`RL_JOIN = (60s, 20)`, `master.rs:57,583`) and covers ONE of three connection lanes. `[V]` DIRECT gets `ip:port` from a single `/v1/join` (`master.rs:605`) and `ConnectDirect` never contacts the master again; `[V]` LAN ONLY never announces. For those two the only limit is the host's own band -- `kMaxPending = 8`, `kPendingDeadlineMs = 30'000`, refused sockets closed immediately -- i.e. hundreds of guesses a minute, not twenty. **Look here FIRST:** when you find a control at one endpoint, enumerate every ROUTE to the protected thing before claiming it is bounded; put the bound where the lanes CONVERGE, and key it on something that survives (a fresh keypair is free, so the remote ADDRESS is the only stable key -- and its CGNAT collateral must then be answered, not ignored). [[lesson-a-guess-bound-at-one-lane-is-not-a-bound]]
- **TWO INDIVIDUALLY-CORRECT COMMENTS CAN COMPOSE INTO ONE WRONG PROGRAM.** 2026-08-31, caught by a post-ship audit on code shipped hours earlier whose commit message claimed the opposite. The producer bumped its fetch generation on every completed attempt ("the ages advanced -- repaint"); the consumer re-stamped its age clock whenever that generation moved ("a new fetch resets the clock; a repaint does not"). Both true. Composed: a FAILED fetch re-stamped "last fetched" every 5 s, so no row aged, the stale-dim was unreachable during an outage -- the only time it means anything -- and the pane printed "updated just now" under "Cannot reach the server list". **Look here FIRST:** when a consumer DERIVES a fact (freshness, age, identity) from a signal the producer emits for another purpose, name both purposes and check they cannot diverge; if the producer's comment says "and also X", it is two signals wearing one name. Fix at the producer -- two questions, two counters. [[lesson-two-correct-comments-can-make-one-wrong-program]]

- **A HARNESS OWES THREE SEPARATE CLAIMS — WHEN IT STOPS, WHERE IT LOOKS, WHAT IT MATCHES — AND EVERY ONE OF THEM FAILS GREEN.** 2026-08-30 (`b7b11978`): adding two phases to the browser selftest exposed three independent holes in `tools/mp.py`, all in one run, none of them reachable by reading the phase code. (1) The early-exit marker still named `WORLD LIST`, a phase that now runs 56 ticks before the last one — the run printed *"selftest complete ... the last phase"* and killed the game BEFORE the new phases executed; a stop keyed on a stale phase never reads as truncation, it reads as a clean run whose last verdicts are simply absent (and this was the SECOND time that marker went stale). (2) The verdict list was scoped to `server_browser` lines while the sibling window logs under `host_window_native`, so the run reported *"no HOST BACK verdict"* with `HOST BACK PASS` sitting in the log — and the contradiction that exposed it is that the STOP marker reads the STREAMED text and had already fired on a line the verdict parser structurally could not see. **Two readers with two scopes is how an instrument reports a hole that is not there.** (3) Lookups matched the phase PREFIX, and every phase logs an AIMING line (`HOST BACK at desktop ... clicking it`) before its verdict — so a FAILING run would have been reported with a line containing neither PASS nor FAIL, a **false green on the exact question the phase exists to answer**, invisible on every passing run. **Look here FIRST when adding a phase to any scenario:** check the early-exit marker still names what is now LAST, check the line filter includes every module the new phases log under, and make lookups match `PASS|FAIL|SKIP` explicitly — then ask whether the instrument would print something DIFFERENT if the feature were broken. [[lesson-a-harness-owes-three-separate-claims-and-each-fails-green]]
- **...AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN THE NEXT DAY, TO THE HAND THAT WROTE THAT ROW.** 2026-08-31: adding the SESSION / LOCK / SESSION BACK phases for `ui/host_session_settings` reproduced holes (1) and (2) verbatim on the same file — the stop marker still named `INPUT NAME`, so the run printed every older verdict green and *"selftest complete"* over the silent absence of the new ones; then the verdict scan's module list did not know `host_session_settings`, so three PASS lines in the log were reported as three UNMEASURED holes. **A checklist you have to remember to run is not a fix.** The list had now been wrong twice in the same direction, which is this project's own signal that the LEVEL is wrong, so the scan was made to notice its own blindness: it now reports any `PASS --`/`FAIL --`/`SKIP --` line in the log that falls OUTSIDE its own scope. **Durable form: make the harness prove it can SEE the thing it is grading** — a scope, a marker or a needle that silently excludes is a green run about nothing. [[lesson-a-harness-owes-three-separate-claims-and-each-fails-green]]
- **A NEGATIVE DRILL CAN REFUSE FOR THE WRONG REASON, AND THREE QUARTERS OF IT STILL GOES GREEN.** 2026-08-31, proving the new lobby password is enforced: `authdrill --arm password` reported *client took no seat / host served no save / no seat spent* all PASS while **the password gate never executed** — the client had refused upstream for a different reason entirely (no advertised host identity on the LAN lane, so the proof may not be emitted at all). **A negative drill's assertions are mostly about ABSENCE, and absence is what every failure produces**; a rig that cannot connect at all satisfies them perfectly. Only the assertion that NAMES A MECHANISM (here: the host's own `WRONG PASSWORD` line) distinguishes "the gate refused you" from "you never reached the gate", and a looser needle — the close reason, a bare `REFUSED`, the client's "join failed" — would have gone 4/4 green over a completely untested gate. **The control arm does not save you**: it proves the arm CAUSED the difference, never which mechanism did. **Look here FIRST:** write the mechanism-naming assertion before the absence ones, point it at the log of the side that OWNS the refusal, and ask *if the subject refused for some other reason, which of my assertions would notice?* [[lesson-a-negative-drill-can-refuse-for-the-wrong-reason]]
- **A FLAG BRIDGING TWO EVENTS MUST BE READ AT THE SECOND ONE -- AND I GOT THIS WRONG TWICE IN A ROW, THE SECOND TIME AS THE FIX FOR THE FIRST.** 2026-08-31, `ui/native_text_field` + the screens that poll it. Escape inside a text field must leave the FIELD, not close the WINDOW -- but the blur happens on `WM_KEYDOWN` (event A, through the WndProc detour) while the screens take their own edge on `GetAsyncKeyState` (event B, a different tick). **Attempt 1** read `AnyFocused()`, a predicate event A DESTROYS, so it was false by the time B asked: it could never fire and never had. **Attempt 2** added a latch and drained it *unconditionally every tick*, so the one true reading was consumed on A's tick and B always saw false -- one Escape still closed the window and discarded the typed password. The comment beside it stated the cause ("drained on the tick it was set") without noticing it was fatal for a consumer reading on B. **And the sibling screen had the mirror image**: it took the PRESS edge from a polled hardware key while the latch waits on a *dispatched message*, and the poll runs inside Slate's tick AFTER the frame's pump -- so a key pressed in the pump-to-tick gap raised the edge with the latch still clear, losing the race about half the time, on the password prompt itself. **The rule: line up SET, READ and CLEARED before writing the guard. If SET and READ are different events, CLEARED must be at READ -- never "every tick", never "at set" -- and every consumer must take the SAME edge.** The level being wrong here is that a polled hardware key and a message-driven flag are two clocks; any guard spanning them owes an explicit edge decision, not an intuition about "when the key is pressed". **Look here FIRST:** draw both timelines and mark the tick each side fires on; if the flag's lifetime does not visibly cover the gap, it is not a guard. [[lesson-a-flag-bridging-two-events-must-be-read-at-the-second-one]]
- **A CHECK WHOSE OUTPUT YOU DO NOT READ IS NOT A CHECK -- AND PRINTING THE EXPECTED ANSWER BESIDE THE ACTUAL ONE IS HOW YOU STOP READING IT.** 2026-08-31, committing on a `tools/mp.py` shared with a parallel session. I ran the correct guard (`grep -c` for the other lane's markers in the working-tree diff), with the correct needle, and printed a label under it: `"--- 0 above = mine alone ---"`. **The guard printed `1`.** I read the number against the label -- written BEFORE the command ran, asserting the answer I expected, sitting directly beneath it -- and committed, swallowing seven lines of their in-flight `--fresh` work under my message. Nothing broke (their code was complete and every drill ran on it); the whole cost was in the record, and the other session would have met its own work already committed by someone else. **An instrument that announces its own expected verdict is a caption, not an instrument.** Same failure as a harness whose scope silently excludes what it grades, one level up, in a shell one-liner. **Look here FIRST:** make the guard ASSERT rather than narrate (`test "$(...)" -eq 0 || { echo ABORT; exit 1; }`) -- a guard that can only print is one you can read past, a guard that can STOP you is not; on a shared tree prefer `git apply --cached` your own hunks over a path-scoped commit that needs a guard at all; and if a guard did fire and you proceeded, say so in the handoff. **Second instance, 2026-09-01, same shape in a build:** I ran `cmake --build ... | tail -18`, read `exit=0`, and concluded my new TU had compiled. It had not -- the pipe discarded the only lines that would have said so, and a later byte-search of the DLL (`[LGC]` -> 0 occurrences) is what caught it; the real build then failed on a macro arity error. **A build's exit code is a claim about what it DID build, and `tail` is how you stop being able to check that claim.** Capture the full log to a file and grep it for YOUR file, or verify the artifact itself (`.obj` present, a known string in the binary) -- and use a POSITIVE CONTROL when you do, because my first binary search used `strings`/`grep`, which returned 0 for a known-present literal too and nearly sent me to the wrong conclusion. [[lesson-a-check-whose-output-you-do-not-read-is-not-a-check]]
- **FAIL-CLOSED IS RIGHT ONLY WHEN FAILING *OPEN* WOULD ADMIT.** 2026-08-31, post-ship audit of the lobby-password guess bound. I keyed it on the remote address and made it refuse when it could not bucket -- and on AUTO/P2P it could NEVER bucket: `[V]` `steamnetworkingtypes.h:690-692` says the address "might be all 0's ... basically everything except direct UDP connection", so every joiner shared one bucket. Ten junk attempts with free throwaway keypairs then locked EVERY honest player out of a locked lobby, indefinitely -- **I had converted "an attacker cannot guess the password" into "an attacker can close the lobby".** Worse, this tree had ALREADY rejected an address-keyed cap for that exact reason, in writing, at `session_status.cpp:168-172`, written by the SAME arc's earlier audit. **The test, in one line: ask what failing OPEN would cost.** If it would ADMIT someone (a death discriminator, an authority check, a version gate) -- fail closed, and [[lesson-an-entity-death-discriminator-must-be-fail-closed]] still holds. If it only means "we did not COUNT this attempt" (a rate limiter, a bucket, a telemetry table) -- failing closed admits nobody and denies everybody, because the attacker still has to produce a correct proof either way. The two are the SAME CODE (`if (!thing) return refuse;`) with the same-sounding comment; the difference is entirely in what the guarded resource is. Note also that the comment's own cost paragraph priced the "CGNAT collateral" as bounded to one address -- arithmetic that assumed a per-attacker bucket that did not exist ten lines above it. **Look here FIRST when writing any limiter/quota/cooldown:** is the KEY present on every lane (grep its header for "might be"/"if known"/"N/A", and grep your own tree for a design REJECTED for keying on it); what happens when the key is absent ("do not bucket, check the real predicate anyway" beats "refuse"); and write the sentence *"when this fails, X cannot Y"* -- if X is an honest user, the direction is wrong. [[lesson-fail-closed-is-right-only-when-failing-open-would-admit]]
- **A VALUE'S SECOND JOB OUTLIVES THE BRANCH ITS FIRST JOB WAS ON.** 2026-08-31: `cfg.hostIdentity` was populated only inside `if (topology == P2P)` — correct for months, because its job was ROUTING and a LAN client dials an address. Then A65 gave the same field a SECOND job (the anchor a joiner binds the host's key to, needed on EVERY lane) and nobody moved the write. Result was a product defect, not a lab one: **a locked lobby was unjoinable over DIRECT and LAN**. It was two layers deep — fixing `ReadNetConfig` changed nothing, because the LAN client never uses that Config: `ConnectDirect` builds a **fresh** `net::Config` that had never heard of the field, or (five minutes later) of the password either. Same defect twice in one session, from fixing the site in front of me instead of asking who CONSTRUCTS the object. **Look here FIRST when a field gains a new reader:** grep every site that WRITES it and ask whether each runs on every path the new reader does; then grep every place the containing struct is constructed fresh, because a second constructor is a second population site no amount of fixing the first one reaches. The fix that held was ONE resolution function per value. [[lesson-a-values-second-job-outlives-the-branch-its-first-job-was-on]]
- **...AND THAT FIX MADE THE PIPE WORK, NOT THE FEATURE — THE VALUE STILL HAD NO SOURCE.** 2026-09-01, correcting the row above by measurement. Populating `cfg.hostIdentity` on every lane was right and was not enough: `[V]` the row it reads, `net.host_identity`, has **three readers and ZERO writers** — no UI anywhere sets it. So a locked lobby stayed unjoinable by address for another day, and the only way in was two hand-edited ini rows plus the host reading its own `dial=` line out of `multivoid.log`. **Look here FIRST after plumbing a value to a new consumer: grep for who WRITES it, not only who reads it.** A field that is correctly threaded and never populated fails exactly like one that was never threaded, and the second fix is in a different subsystem from the first (here: a UI text box, not the net layer). Closed 2026-09-01 by letting a self-addressed lane carry the password instead — see the row on safety arguments below. [[lesson-a-values-second-job-outlives-the-branch-its-first-job-was-on]]
- **A SAFETY ARGUMENT BESIDE A CONSTANT IS A DEPENDENCY EDGE, NOT PROSE.** 2026-09-01, one session, 100 minutes, same author. At 12:40 I shortened the generated lobby password to six characters at the user's request and wrote, honestly, that 30 bits is safe **only** because a proof is never sent to an unbound host — listing two consequences as "**neither optional while this constant is 6**", the second being that a typed address "cannot be given a password escape hatch". At 14:22 I shipped that escape hatch and never revisited the argument; **two files kept asserting the deleted precondition in the present tense**, one of them the header calling itself "the ONE owner of what a lobby password is worth". Each commit passed its own review — the defect exists only in the SEAM, and a diff cannot show a seam, because the invalidated file did not change. **Look here FIRST: when a comment says "safe only because X", grep X's SYMBOL before touching X**, and name the guard by symbol rather than in prose so the dependent is findable. Note also the shape: shortening a secret does not merely reduce a margin, it **promotes a control from belt-and-braces to load-bearing** — and that is the moment it was removed. [[lesson-a-safety-argument-beside-a-constant-is-a-dependency]]
- **A GATE WHOSE CORPUS IS PARTLY ABSENT MUST SAY "UNVERIFIABLE", NOT "DEAD".** 2026-09-01. CI had been failing at `tools/docs/lessons_gate.py` with `DEAD CITATIONS (10)`; the same gate on the same commit printed PASS locally. `resolve_cite` skips a search root that does not exist, and `research/` is gitignored while `reference/` is a submodule CI deliberately never fetches — so every MTA citation resolves to nothing there. **Ten citations, no rot, unfixable by editing the ledger.** The sharpest part: the SAME gate's symbol half already drew the distinction ("corpus absent … reports the instrument, not the ledger") and the citation half did not. **Look here FIRST when a checker fails on one machine and passes on another: compare the CORPUS, not the input** — the commit is identical. A resolver that skips a missing root owes three outcomes (found / absent / dead); two forces absence to masquerade, and it picks the loud one. Do NOT reach for the allowlist: "not in this repo anywhere" and "not in this checkout" are different claims. [[lesson-a-gate-with-a-partly-absent-corpus-must-say-absent-not-dead]]
- **A NEGATIVE DRILL INVERTS WHEN ITS DEFECT IS FIXED — RE-PURPOSE IT, DO NOT DELETE THE RED.** 2026-09-01. `mp.py authdrill --arm password --unbound` asserted that a locked host REFUSES a typed address, and passed 4/4 that morning. The user then ruled that a typed address should carry a password: the refusal WAS the defect, so the fix turned the drill red while the client log showed a completed join. A drill red normally means a regression — that is why it is trusted — and the cheap escape (delete the arm, skip-list it) is silent, because a deleted test leaves no failing line. It became an ordinary arm with a control: `--unbound` = wrong password must REFUSE, `--unbound --control` = correct password must JOIN. **Coverage went UP.** **Look here FIRST on a red after a deliberate behaviour change: ask whether the drill's CLAIM changed, not its subject** — and never resolve a red by deletion without writing down which measurement stopped existing. [[lesson-a-negative-drill-inverts-when-its-defect-is-fixed]]
- **`git commit -- <paths>` COMMITS THE WORKING TREE AND DISCARDS YOUR INDEX; `--amend` REWRITES WHATEVER HEAD IS *NOW*.** 2026-09-01, both within minutes, on a repo a second session was using. I split a shared `tools/mp.py` diff, staged only my hunks with `git apply --cached`, verified `git diff --cached` — then committed with an explicit pathspec and landed **188 insertions instead of 166, with the other session's work in it**. The pathspec form READS as a filter and is recommended for exactly this situation; it does filter, and it also bypasses the index. Minutes later `git commit --amend` rewrote the `[lights]` commit the parallel session had made in between, replacing its message with mine. **Look here FIRST: staging and a pathspec are mutually exclusive** — if you selected hunks, commit with NO pathspec; if you pass paths, do not build an index. Confirm `git log -1 --format=%s` is still yours before any `--amend`. Repair without disturbing a live session: `commit-tree` against a separate `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, prove `git diff old new` is empty, then `update-ref` with the expected-old argument. [[lesson-git-commit-with-a-pathspec-ignores-the-index]]
- **A SECURITY RATIONALE IN A PUBLIC REPO OBEYS THE KEEP/CUT RULE — AND THE FIVE-AXIS LEAK AUDIT CANNOT SEE IT.** 2026-09-01, caught in my own pre-push check. Justifying a gate relaxation, I wrote a comment naming the security register's OPEN finding by ID, quoting its mechanism, and drawing its consequence — and put the same paragraphs in the commit message. The leak audit passed: its axes look for ARTIFACTS (IPs, secrets, local paths, identity), and this was PROSE. `DOCS_ARC` §WP-2 already governs it: CUT a specific *unfixed* attack and its effect, KEEP the architectural statement and an honest non-actionable posture. The same sweep had removed the same class from two docs in August; I reproduced it in `src/`, which is public and always was. **Look here FIRST before pushing any comment or message explaining a security decision: would this sentence help someone attack a shipped build?** Check the code and the commit message together — they are written in one motion and leak identically, and only the code gets re-read. [[lesson-a-security-rationale-in-a-public-repo-obeys-the-keep-cut-rule]]
- **A FILE-HASH GATE CAN ONLY BE MINTED WHERE IT IS CHECKED.** 2026-09-01. `tools/release/fingerprint.json` records `Get-FileHash SHA256` over `build-core.yml`; the same commit hashed `ee31357e…` in my working tree and `7299feb0…` on the runner. Not a changed file (though one HAD changed, which is the satisfying wrong answer you stop at) -- **line endings**: my tree was LF, CI checks out CRLF, and rewriting the bytes to CRLF locally reproduced the runner's value exactly. I first ruled line endings out with `grep -c $'
'` returning 0, which counts LINES CONTAINING a match, not characters -- a real command giving a real number that means something else. **Look here FIRST when a hash/size/checksum disagrees between two machines on the same commit: compare the BYTES.** Rewrite to the other line ending in a temp copy and re-hash; use `cat -A`/`xxd`, never `grep -c`. Any gate whose reference is a hash of a TEXT file in a repo with translation can only be minted by the platform that checks it -- run the tool there and commit its output, never compute it by hand. Such a gate also invalidates itself whenever the hashed file changes (that is the feature), so sequence the mint AFTER the last edit or you mint twice, as I did. [[lesson-a-file-hash-gate-can-only-be-minted-where-it-is-checked]]
- **A GUARD ADDED TO A LANE THAT CANNOT SATISFY IT DISABLES THE LANE, SILENTLY.** 2026-09-01, ninety minutes, two individually-correct steps. `package.ps1` documented that a CI zip may be pak-less while a RELEASE zip must carry the starter skins, and enforced NEITHER -- so both lanes produced the same artifact and a CI-published release would have shipped structurally correct and content-incomplete. I added `-Release` to fail closed. Correct fix, except `release-core.yml` publishes from `runs-on: windows-latest` and `assets/paks/*` was gitignored, so the runner's checkout had no paks: I had converted "ships half a release" into "cannot release", discoverable only by pushing a tag. Every test stayed green -- the guard's own RED/GREEN drill passed, and the CI lane is *allowed* to be pak-less. **Look here FIRST when adding a fail-closed check: name the lane that must satisfy it and go read where that lane RUNS** — for release/CI scripts that is a fresh checkout on a hosted runner, not your tree with its untracked files. `git ls-files <path>` answers "is this tracked", and `ls` does not. Keep the guard when you remove its cause (the property outlives the reason), but fix its MESSAGE: mine kept blaming a gitignore that no longer existed. [[lesson-a-guard-added-to-a-lane-nobody-runs-disables-it]]
- **A DERIVED VALUE MAY NOT PRESERVE WHAT IT LOOKS DERIVED FROM -- READ THE MAPPING BEFORE DELETING THE SOURCE.** 2026-09-01. The Thunderstore `description` ended "Multivoid 0.9.0n b150", spending a fifth of the scarcest line in the product (the one r2modman's list renders) on what `version_number` 0.9.150 seemed to restate, and I was ready to cut the clause whole. `ledger_lib.ps1:317-327` is `"$major.$minor.$Proto"` over `-replace '\D',''` per field -- so the two halves behave OPPOSITELY: `b150` really is redundant (it IS the patch field, and is in the dependency string and version list too), while `0.9.0n` is destroyed by that mapping (third field and letter both gone; `0.9.0n` and a later `0.9.1a` both map to `0.9`) and the description is its only home on the surface a player reads before installing. **Look here FIRST before deleting a field as "already covered by the derived one": open the derivation and ask what it DESTROYS** -- hunt the lossy ops (`-replace`, `int()`, a `split` taking fewer fields, a case fold), and split the claim per component, because here one half of a six-word phrase was duplicated and the other was the only copy. And when you write the comment that justifies keeping it, NAME the dropped part: "the information the mapping drops" is unfalsifiable and did not save me; "the letter suffix, because the mapping strips non-digits" is one grep. [[lesson-a-derived-value-may-not-preserve-what-it-looks-derived-from]]

- **A SYMPTOM NEEDS A BASELINE BEFORE IT NEEDS A HYPOTHESIS.** 2026-08-31, the death arc, and the most expensive process failure of the session. The user reported a revived player standing at the KPP with the screen washed red. Four investigations followed -- damage-indicator quadrants, the `effect_bloodLoss_C` PostProcess, the `ui_bloodLossBlur` widget, then a full enumeration of every viewport widget and the whole effect system (`effects_names.Num=0`) -- each finding something real, each measuring its own target CLEAN, each followed by the user saying "still red" (and, correctly, *"ты заебал уже"*). Then ONE screenshot taken during what the instrument called the ALIVE CONTROL WINDOW came back **fully red**, and I concluded the tint belonged to the WORLD in that save. **THAT SECOND CONCLUSION WAS ALSO WRONG -- see the next row, which retracts it:** the frame was taken one second AFTER the lethal hit and paired with a health read from eleven seconds earlier; the red was the damage HUD all along. Two of the four fixes were real defects worth keeping. **The tell, ignored three times: the probe is green and the observer disagrees.** That never means "find the next candidate" -- it means the measurement and the observation are not about the same thing. **Look here FIRST:** when a user reports something VISIBLE, capture the same observation with the feature INACTIVE before proposing any cause, and use the channel THEY used (they were looking at a screen; float reads cannot see a post-process, a light, a shader, or a widget you did not think to name -- and they report success honestly while missing it). `tools/mp.py`'s `_capture_window` does it for any VotV PID in one call; `research/death_shots/A_prehit_*.png` vs `B_postrevive_*.png` is the precedent. Cost: four hypotheses at ~20 min each, against one screenshot in the first minute. [[lesson-a-symptom-needs-a-baseline-before-it-needs-a-hypothesis]]

- **A SCREENSHOT AND A LOG LINE ARE TWO INSTANTS -- CHECK THE TIMESTAMPS BEFORE PAIRING THEM.** 2026-08-31, the same red screen, later the same day -- and it **RETRACTS the row above**, which is why both are kept. The "already fully red at full health" frame that closed the investigation above was **not taken at full health**. `mp.py`'s `_shot_before_and_after` polled for the log line `death_test: ALIVE control window`, then captured. In the preserved log that line and `death_test: delivered Add Player Damage(200, blood=true)` are ADJACENT statements in the SAME SECOND, and the PNG was written one second later -- so **every "A_prehit" frame the instrument ever produced was a POST-hit frame**. The analysis then paired that PNG with `health=100.00` from the `pre-hit state` line logged ELEVEN SECONDS EARLIER. Two measurements, two times, read as one observation -- and the output was a phantom "world-level red" that survived four probes plus a full render-pipeline sweep (fade / fog / blendables / colour grading / graphics settings / DX11-vs-DX12) and got written into `docs/DEATH_ARC.md` 11.3a as a negative-evidence table whose every row was wrong. The real answer was the one the user gave in their first sentence: the damage screen effect. **Look here FIRST:** when a "measured" table contradicts what the user is looking at, run `ls --time-style=+%H:%M:%S` on its artifacts and check they share a second with the log lines they are paired to -- before re-deriving a single row. And a MARKER NAMES A CODE LOCATION, NOT A MOMENT: read the two or three statements after it in the source before trusting it as a capture trigger (`ALIVE control window` is logged when the window ENDS, immediately before the hit). Name a capture after WHEN it fires, not after what you hope it shows -- `A_at_control_window` would have made the bug visible on the filename. Falsifier + instrument: `mp.py hudtint` (`harness/autotest_hud_tint.cpp`), which shows a New Game, the accused save, sessionless, and death-armed-pre-hit all CLEAN at `health=100.00`. [[lesson-a-screenshot-and-a-log-line-are-two-instants]]
- **A REFERENCE CAPTURE MUST MATCH THE CONDITIONS OF THE REPORT.** 2026-08-31, the server browser's frame. The user said our window frame was not VOTV's and later, with zoom crops, *"видишь же что у votv много скосов на рамке"*. I sampled the native reference, reported ONE pair of 2 px bands, matched our output to it byte-for-byte, and would have shipped. `ignore_folder/votv_widgets_style/` holds ELEVEN captures and I had picked **the SMALLEST (546x570)**; `SERVER_BROWSER_4_keybinds_tab_opens_new_window.png` beside it is **1885x1046** and samples the pair **TWICE back to back** -- that doubling WAS the complaint. (Its CAUSE was misread a second time, and the correction is its own row above: the second pair is a NESTED panel's ring, not a second ring on the window.) My reference could not contain the phenomenon being reported, so every number I took from it was exact, reproducible, and answering a different question; a MATCH is the most convincing evidence there is, and it was a match to the wrong ground truth. A fresh /qf critic caught it in its first question, purely by listing the folder. **Look here FIRST:** `ls` the whole reference set WITH dimensions before picking one, and justify the pick in a line; ask what conditions (resolution, UI scale, version, state) the report was made under and choose the artifact that shares them; and when the user supplies their OWN artifact, that is the ground truth -- prefer it over anything curated in the repo. [[lesson-a-reference-capture-must-match-the-conditions-of-the-report]]
- **BOUNDING A RESOURCE-OWNING RUNNER WITH AN EXTERNAL `timeout` ORPHANS ITS CLEANUP.** 2026-08-31, twice in one evening. `timeout 400 python tools/mp.py browser` kills the runner before its teardown, so the launched VotV process AND `ignore_folder/_GAME_LOCK.json` survive it. The next run then prints `REFUSING to launch: another session holds the game rig` naming a pid that was already dead, and `deploy-all` fails with `IOException ... used by another process` on the DLL -- **the failure presents as somebody else's fault**, which is the exact misattribution `docs/CROSS_SESSION.md` exists to prevent, except the "other session" was my own previous command. `timeout` feels like a safety measure and is, for a pure computation; for a runner that owns external resources the thing you bounded is the thing that would have cleaned up, and the damage surfaces one or two commands later wearing a different costume. **Look here FIRST:** give the runner its OWN stop condition (`--probe-timeout`/`--duration`, or a stall break) instead of wrapping it; when a lock refusal names a pid, check that pid is alive before believing it -- dead holder + live game process is the orphan signature; and a `Copy-Item ... used by another process` on the deployed DLL means a game is still up. [[lesson-bounding-a-runner-with-timeout-orphans-its-cleanup]]
- **A CANCELLED DESTRUCTION HAS NO AUTHORED UNDO TO INHERIT.** 2026-08-31, death arc (`docs/DEATH_ARC.md` 11.5, `6ccbb509`). We veto VOTV's death travel so the world survives, which leaves every one-way write the death made standing -- the game never needed an undo because the travel was about to destroy the world. The natural fix, and the one my own memory file had recorded as the next step, was *"vanilla's disposal IS the rebuild -- destroy and recreate `ui_UI` and inherit VOTV's own disposal, free, forever, no census"*. **Measurement killed it twice over.** `[V]` `ui_UI` has 47 functions and **no `Destruct`**; its `Construct` binds `heavyObjDrop`/`heavyObjPull` onto OTHER objects' multicast delegates and starts `K2_SetTimerDelegate(timeDsplay, 0.5, looping)`, and nothing unbinds either -- so with `RemoveFromParent` merely DETACHING, a mid-level rebuild leaves the old widget reachable through those delegates and that timer: permanent double-dispatch plus a per-death leak. Vanilla is safe only because **the LEVEL TRAVEL destroys the world and its timer manager**, which has no single-object form. And more broadly: vanilla's disposal ENDS THE SESSION, so the game has **no authored answer** for "what should this look like after a *survived* death" -- "restore the fresh/authored state" is our invention wearing the game's clothes, and `[V]` it is measurably wrong (`ui_UI` holds `compassLocation`, `selec`, `stacking`, `hideInterface`, `umg_carmap->beacons` and runtime-added subtitle/achievement children that nothing re-drives). **Look here FIRST:** before designing any "restore what the cancelled operation would have disposed of", ask what the game's disposal actually IS at the scope you cancelled -- if it is a world teardown, stop looking for an object-local equivalent -- then check the object for a teardown and for `Construct`-time outward binds/timers. The workable shape is to MEASURE what changed and dispose of exactly that. [[lesson-a-cancelled-destruction-has-no-authored-undo-to-inherit]]
- **A COMPARISON UNIT COARSER THAN THE FINDING ERASES IT (KEY) OR MIS-NAMES IT (CELL).** 2026-08-31, two instances in one instrument in one afternoon (`coop/dev/death_write_diff`, `6ccbb509`). (1) The noise floor keyed on **declaring class + field**, and `Visibility` is declared on `UWidget` -- so `Widget.Visibility` was ONE key covering every widget in the game, and a single flickering `text_clockTime_colon` in the control window would have suppressed `dmg_full.Visibility`, *the one cell the module exists to find*. It survived run 1 purely because no widget's visibility happened to move: **one blinking clock colon from grading itself clean.** (2) Cells were `memcmp` over `ElementSize*ArrayDim`, but a `uint8 flag : 1` reports the whole BYTE, so one change was reported once per flag packed into it and attributed to all of them (`bNetAddressable C7->07` and `bReplicates C7->07` are the SAME byte) -- and it **manufactured a finding that survived analysis**: `ui_UI_C.Hidden 00 -> 01` read as an unhandled HUD write until a bytecode search found `[V]` **nothing writes `ui_UI_C.Hidden`**. Both defects make the instrument look BETTER (a tidier diff; more plausible findings) and neither throws. Fixes: key on the object name with its `_<digits>` instance suffix stripped; compare only the real `{byte, mask}` from `FindBoolProperty`. **Look here FIRST:** state a differ's KEY and its CELL explicitly, write down the finest finding you need, and confirm it has its own key and that its compared span is the datum and not a container shared with neighbours -- then ask what the noise floor would have eaten had the world been noisier. [[lesson-a-comparison-unit-coarser-than-the-finding-erases-it]]
- **A CHAIN-DERIVED DESIGN IS BLIND TO SIDE EFFECTS AUTHORED BEFORE THE CHAIN.** 2026-08-31, the death arc. Eight `/qf` rounds and a full bytecode disassembly produced a six-write revive derived from the death CHAIN -- `kill` -> `ragdollMode` -> `fallen` -> `dead := true` -> two delays -> `loadLevel`. It shipped, went 9/9 green, and the USER LOOKED AT A FRAME: the revived player was standing at the KPP at full health with the entire screen washed red. **TWO** independent artifacts, and neither is on the chain -- both are authored by `Add Player Damage` BEFORE the chain starts, as side effects of the DAMAGE rather than of the death: `@4269` accumulates `damage/maxHealth*4` into one of four `umg_damageIndicator` quadrant floats, and `@3414` calls `addEffect('bloodLoss', ...)` which SPAWNS an effect actor whose PostProcess washes the world (`@2838` pins its duration at the 120 s cap for ANY lethal hit -- and that one is not cosmetic, since a revive that writes full health while leaving the player BLEEDING OUT is incoherent). No further round of chain analysis could have found either; they are not reachable from the control flow the design was reasoning about. **Look here FIRST:** when you cancel or replace a terminal step, the state to restore is everything the WHOLE episode wrote, not everything the chain you traced wrote -- so walk the ENTRY function's siblings and side effects too, and then RENDER A FRAME. A design that has never been looked at has only been proven self-consistent. [[lesson-a-chain-derived-design-is-blind-to-side-effects-before-the-chain]]
- **A CONJUNCTION MUST GATE ON WHAT YOU WOULD PAY TO FIX, NOT ON EVERYTHING YOU DID.** 2026-08-31, same arc, caught by a run that failed 1 time in 4. The revive verified six writes by read-back and treated the whole thing as pass/fail; one of the terms was "the black-screen widget left the viewport", and the same-frame `IsInViewport` read after `RemoveFromParent` intermittently still returned TRUE. The conjunction refused, the failure path ran exactly as designed -- and it threw the living player to the MAIN MENU and (on a host) ENDED THE LOBBY, **because a widget had not detached yet.** The failure cost was wildly out of proportion to what failed, and it was the very outcome the arc exists to prevent. **Look here FIRST:** for every term in an all-or-nothing check, ask *what happens when only this term fails, and is that better or worse than the defect it detects?* Terms whose failure is cosmetic belong in a RETRIED best-effort cleanup, not in the gate; keep in the gate only what means the operation did not achieve its purpose. Note the runtime's give-up threshold and the TEST's bar are different questions and may legitimately differ -- the arm that asserts the cosmetic thing stays, it just no longer decides. [[lesson-a-conjunction-must-gate-on-what-you-would-pay-to-fix]]
- **A SYNTHETIC TRIGGER MUST STAY INSIDE THE RANGE THE GAME ITSELF PRODUCES -- IN MAGNITUDE AND IN PARAMETERS.** 2026-08-31, the death instrument, two failures from one cause. (1) MAGNITUDE: it hit for `maxHealth * 10` "so it is lethal under any scaling", but `[V]` the only scaling on the whole path is `SelectFloat(0.75, 1.0, isStrong)` -- damage is never scaled UP -- so the 10x bought nothing and put FORTY units into a damage-indicator quadrant instead of eight, manufacturing a full-screen red wash that read as a bug in the code under test. (2) PARAMETERS: `InvokeAddPlayerDamage` set only `Damage`, leaving the BP's `blood` parameter false -- and `[V]` `@2784 IFNOT(blood) POP` gates the entire `addEffect('bloodLoss', ...)` block, so the synthetic death never created the blood-loss effect and the arm written specifically to catch it reported "0 live actors" as a **PASS on the run it was added for**. **Look here FIRST:** when a test drives the game's own verb, diff your call against a real one field by field -- an out-of-range magnitude invents artifacts you will debug as defects, and an unset parameter silently deletes a code path so its arm grades nothing. [[lesson-a-synthetic-trigger-must-stay-in-the-games-own-range]]

- **ASK WHAT THE SUBSTRATE ALREADY DOES BEFORE DESIGNING THE MECHANISM — three subsystems died in ONE /qf pass.** 2026-08-30, the server-browser redesign: (1) a "Connecting… / Cancel" modal with its own timeout and failure surface — `coop/session/join_progress.h` already owned all of it (cover+Cancel, `Fail(reason)` -> connect-failed dialog, `RefuseJoin`, `MaybeTimeout`, one restore site); (2) an overlay dialog + scrim + `DialogOpen()` input-exclusivity layer that survived TWO rounds — the GAME's own Language window (a user capture already on disk) does sub-windows as switcher SIBLINGS, so exclusivity is structural and the layer evaporated; (3) a text-window trim engine (measuring block, 0.62-em constant, ratio correction, tail slicing, surrogate care) — Slate's slot `HAlign_Right` clips the HEAD for free, any font, zero ticks. Each was individually defensible and each was killed by a fresh critic asking the LOOKUP question the primary skipped. **Look here FIRST:** before designing any mechanism, check three layers in order — our own modules (grep the concept: lifecycle/cover/latch/cancel), the GAME (how does VOTV solve this same UI problem — captures + BP dumps are on disk), the FRAMEWORK (Slate/UMG/ImGui clipping, alignment, hit-testing). Build only what survives all three. [[lesson-ask-what-the-substrate-already-does-before-designing-the-mechanism]]
 **Fourth instance 2026-09-02, the worst shape:** `docs/DOCUMENTIZE_ARC.md`'s first draft proposed `ledger_rot.py` for checks `tools/docs/lessons_gate.py` had run in CI since `99445efb` -- and the ledger row the draft QUOTED for its motivation names the gate in its second sentence. Read the body of a row you cite, and `ls tools/docs/` before proposing a tool.
- **OUTWARD-FACING COPY GETS AN AI-MARKER PASS BEFORE IT SHIPS (USER, twice 2026-08-30).**
  SUPPORT.md and the whole multivoid.dev copy both came back with «слишком ai вайбы»; the pass
  that satisfied both reviews strips: em-dash-as-default-connector, corporate jargon in player
  prose ("single source of truth", "zero X", "sync lanes", "substrate", "posture"), the "X, not
  Y" contrast tic, fragment openers ("The way in." / "Straight answer."), rhetorical CTA
  questions, most rule-of-three parallels, a signature noun-list repeated across sections, and
  chiasmus flourishes. Concrete beats abstract; the lore/terminal lines are voice, keep them.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/feedback-outward-copy-gets-an-ai-marker-pass.md` (the full list);
  the applied diff is site repo `dfd0040`.

- **A LAB TOOL THAT DEPLOYS FOR YOU SUBSTITUTES THE BYTES UNDER TEST -- PIN, DO NOT CHECK.**
  2026-08-29. Every `tools/mp.py` scenario calls `deploy_all()` at dispatch and copies whatever sits
  in `build/votv-coop/Release` AT THAT INSTANT. With a parallel session building in the same tree,
  *build -> verify the hash -> run the scenario* does not test what it appears to: three verdicts in
  one evening ran foreign bytes (deployed `57B3D7B5`, build dir `7F77BB0E`, intended `DFAEFDB4`), and
  each read as a result. One of them produced the session's only `CLOSE BUTTON PASS`, which was then
  reasoned about for an hour and seeded two further runs chasing a difference that never existed --
  a flake and a foreign binary are indistinguishable from the log. `CROSS_SESSION.md`'s old advice
  ("redeploy before a run you intend to trust, and `md5sum` it") checks the WRONG FILE at the WRONG
  TIME, because the tool re-deploys after you looked. *Look FIRST:* copy your DLL to a named file
  outside the build tree, place THAT in the rig yourself, re-read the hash FROM THE RIG after the
  copy, and print it beside the verdicts (`scratchpad/browser_pinned.ps1` is the shape). Never use an
  `mp.py` scenario for a differential while another session builds. Sibling from the same evening: a
  build failed with `error C2039` in a file I had never touched, because the other session's
  UNCOMMITTED `protocol.h` had reshaped a payload mid-edit -- **a broken build in a shared tree is
  not evidence about your change.**
  `memory/lesson-a-lab-tool-that-deploys-for-you-substitutes-the-bytes-under-test.md`

- **A CONTROL THAT SHARES YOUR CHANGE IS NOT A CONTROL.** 2026-08-29. An extraction was
  proven by running the browser lab on the pre-extraction DLL and the extracted one: every
  phase matched, `CLOSE BUTTON FAIL` included. The inference -- *identical on both arms,
  therefore pre-existing* -- named a five-day-old commit (`23481e3c`, which had rewritten the
  X's own title row) and went into a commit message as fact. **Both DLLs carried a DIFFERENT
  fix shipped an hour earlier**: the mod-environment census, newly reachable on a native menu
  launch, armed a MODAL at boot, and the ImGui overlay takes the mouse while a modal is up --
  so `IsHovered` answered false on either arm. A differential can only see what DIFFERS. What
  settled it was the SCREENSHOT the same run had already captured (the X plainly visible, a
  `MOD INSTALL PROBLEM` modal on top of the screen under test), after 70 sweep probes had
  narrowed *where* the button was while the real answer was *what was over it*. Then
  `GetDesiredSize` read **(53,48)** -- a real hit area -- and with the trigger removed the
  sweep found it at client **(1394,246)** on probe 17 and the click closed the screen:
  `CLOSE BUTTON PASS`. *Look FIRST:* before concluding "not mine", list what shipped between
  the last RECORDED pass and now, and make sure at least one arm predates ALL of it. And when
  a hit-test, click or focus query fails EVERYWHERE, look at a frame -- occlusion, a captured
  pointer and a missing widget are indistinguishable from inside the hit-test.
  `memory/lesson-a-control-that-shares-your-change-is-not-a-control.md`

- **A BISECT PROVES ITS OWN RIG, NOT THE COMPONENT.** 2026-08-29. Disabling six UE4SS Lua
  mods took one save from ~75 to ~119 fps on the dev rig **with a negative arm** (re-enabling
  returned it to ~80) -- real, causal, reproducible, and written up as "those mods are
  expensive" into a player-facing dialog, INSTALL.md, the audit template and CREDITS.md.
  Then the control environment was finally READ: `[V]` the user's r2modman `UE4SS.log` shows
  all six `Starting Lua mod`, and `BPModLoaderMod` mounting the same `DebugMod.pak`, at ~120
  fps. The "expensive" set was running, unchanged, in the environment that was already fast --
  so the component is common to both and the RIG is not (`ue4ss.dll` Git SHA `d935b5b` vs
  `e31aaaa6`, both self-labelled v3.0.1 Beta #0). A negative arm rules out coincidence WITHIN
  a machine and says nothing about attribution across machines. *Look FIRST:* when a
  regression is established by comparing two environments, the fast one's config is EVIDENCE
  -- read it before the bisect and again before the writeup; if it runs the same component,
  that component is excluded however clean your bisect was. For a loader stack the cheap reads
  are each side's `UE4SS.log` banner (`Git SHA #...`), its `Starting Lua mod` lines and
  `BPModLoaderMod`'s mount log -- what RAN, not what a config file permits.

- **A MIXED-EOL file turns a 3-line edit into a whole-file diff -- and buries a co-worker's
  hunks.** 2026-08-29: three added rows in `config_registry_rows.inc` staged as **752 changed
  lines (379+/373-)**, because `git show HEAD:<path> | file -` reports that file as *"CRLF, CR,
  LF line terminators"* and a normal write normalized all of it. `docs/LESSONS.md` is mixed too
  (its section 7 is LF while other regions are CRLF -- which is why `
` string anchors fail
  there), and the repo has **no `.gitattributes`**, so nothing normalizes on the way in and
  nothing warns. This matters beyond tidiness because a parallel session is usually editing the
  same docs: the standing `git diff --cached --stat` foreign-line check is DEFEATED by an EOL
  rewrite, since every line then looks like yours. *Look FIRST:* when `--cached --stat` shows a
  line count far larger than your edit, suspect line endings before suspecting yourself --
  confirm with `git show HEAD:<path> | file -`, then `git checkout HEAD -- <path>` and re-apply
  in BINARY with the bytes the file already uses. For a shared file, extract only your hunks and
  `git apply --cached` after a `--check` dry run (done here: 5 hunks present, 1 mine). Matching
  traps: bash's `/tmp` and a Windows `python` do not share a path (use the scratchpad), and
  `grep` calls a mixed-EOL file "Binary file ... matches" -- pass `-a`.

- **A RULE-2 DELETION CENSUS MUST INCLUDE *RELEASED* BUILDS, NOT JUST THE WORKING TREE.**
  2026-08-29, caught by a `/qf` critic. `peerIdentity` had **zero** readers in HEAD and a comment
  saying so, so a sweep called the master's mint stranded dead output. `[V]` b133 -- 1,138
  downloads, the newest build the public can have -- reads it at `lobby_client.cpp:162` and makes
  it **required** at `:174` (`info.ok = !info.peerIdentity.empty() && ...`), so the deletion would
  not have degraded released joins, it would have **failed every one outright**. The grep was
  right, the comment was right, the conclusion was wrong: both describe *this* build. *Look
  FIRST:* any "nothing uses X" is a claim about a **set of builds**, and the set that matters is
  everything still talking to your servers -- `git show <tag>:<path>` for every tag in
  `gh release list`, and check whether the released consumer treats it as REQUIRED or optional
  ("loses a feature" vs "cannot connect" are different releases). Make a comment say *where*: "no
  longer read **by this build**" is the sentence that prompts the tag census.
  `memory/lesson_a_deletion_census_must_include_released_builds.md`

- **A SPEC YOU *DEFER* TO IS ONE NOBODY HAS TRIED -- its feasibility is unverified by
  construction.** 2026-08-29. `PLAN_01` §6's P1 fork ("refuse unless the remote identity equals
  `m_msgCertRemote.key_data()`") was deferred as costly, and meanwhile **cited in
  `peer_identity.h` as the reason** for a shipped decision. `[V]` It cannot be implemented at all:
  `SetLocalCertUnsigned` is **per-connection** and mints `key_data` itself
  (`connections.cpp:1303-1314`), so satisfying it needs an identity that differs per connection
  AND equals a value we do not choose. Everything that catches a bad spec -- compiler, test,
  drill -- is downstream of *executing* it, so a deferred plan is never checked and reads more
  authoritative the longer it sits. It was also the SECOND reason for a decision whose first
  reason (RULE 2) was sound, so the false half did no visible work and nothing pointed at it.
  *Look FIRST:* when a comment justifies a live decision by citing a plan, open the plan and check
  the mechanism is **possible**, not just expensive; read the function that *produces* the value
  the spec compares against, since feasibility usually fails on the producer's lifetime. And
  `inferred` in your own brief is an instruction to yourself.
  `memory/lesson_a_deferred_specs_own_feasibility_is_unchecked.md`

- **A FIXTURE THE RIG TESTS AGAINST DRIFTS FROM PRODUCTION, AND THE RIG REPORTS GREEN WHILE IT
  DOES.** 2026-08-29. Four scenarios launched `tools/coop_signaling_server.py`, a Python lookalike
  kept past its cutover because it started without cargo; `[V]` the production Rust binary builds
  in **9.86 s** from cold, so the reason had expired while the cost had not -- a line-protocol
  change would have landed in two implementations with the rig proving it against the copy that
  never ships. Proof it is not hypothetical: pointing the *sibling* `master_smoke` at production
  produced **five FAILs**, each an assertion encoding the fixture's behaviour where production
  deliberately differs (three are the TURN credential binding a 2026-07-16 audit moved to IP
  buckets). Nothing ever fails at the moment of divergence -- the instrument whose job is to
  notice it is pointed at the wrong side. *Look FIRST:* if a test double implements a wire
  contract that also has a real implementation, ask what running the real one costs; seconds means
  the double is liability. Retire it in its OWN commit with before/after evidence on an
  **unchanged** protocol, then change the protocol -- and read every FAIL from the first
  production run as a finding, not a porting chore. (A *fixture* that never claimed the contract,
  like `fake_master.py`, cannot drift and stays.)

- **BEFORE A VALUE BECOMES *OURS*, CENSUS WHAT IT ALREADY *IS* -- and grep its WRITERS, not its
  readers.** 2026-08-29. The peer-identity design claimed GNS's process-global identity as "the
  public key" and shipped an `InstallInto` for it, after 13 `/qf` rounds. `[V]` `Session::StartP2P`
  then called `ResetIdentity` **again**, 150 lines later, with the master's per-session `h<16hex>`
  mint -- so on P2P, our PRIMARY transport, the durable identity never reached the wire, silently,
  because nothing yet READ a remote identity. The design had asked *"can this hold 32 bytes?"*
  (`[V]` yes) and never *"what is this slot currently FOR?"* -- it was already the signaling
  rendezvous address. A `/qf` critic cannot catch this: it interrogates the design's frame, and the
  frame never contained "something else already writes this". **The tell was present and read as
  trivia:** the plan owed a 64->80 char cap raise on the SIGNALING path, a path the design never
  mentioned. *Look FIRST:* for a process-global setter, grep the WRITERS (a reader census answers
  "who sees our value", a writer census answers "is it still there"); treat capacity ("it is exactly
  32 bytes") as never being evidence a slot is free; and follow any cap/validation/serialiser that
  turns up on a path your design does not mention. Resolved by MERGING the two systems (RULE 2), not
  by sequencing the writes -- which also kept `PLAN_01` s6's GNS fork viable.

- **A NEGATIVE ARM'S TWO INPUTS MUST BE *ASSERTED* DIFFERENT, NOT ASSUMED -- or it reports a defect
  that does not exist.** 2026-08-29. The admission selftest's third-party arm ("a proof for
  counterparty A must not verify inside a blob naming B") went RED on BOTH peers with a precise,
  alarming and completely wrong diagnosis. The blob builder was fine: the fixture declared two
  synthetic counterparties, randomised the PRIVATE halves, and never derived the public ones -- so
  `pkA == pkB == all zeroes` and the two "different" blobs were byte-identical. **This is the mirror
  of the familiar failure** (`lesson_an_instrument_never_shown_failing_passes_by_construction`): not
  silence, but a confident RED pointing at production code, made more convincing by reproducing
  identically on both peers -- which is exactly what a deterministic broken fixture does and a real
  crypto bug usually does not. *Look FIRST:* any assertion of the form "X must NOT match Y" owes a
  preceding `X != Y`; when a negative arm goes red, suspect the FIXTURE before the subject; and fill
  the value you actually COMPARE, not the one it derives from (zero-init leaves a *valid-looking* 32
  bytes, which is what makes the class invisible).

- **A RENAMED LOG LINE OWES A CENSUS OF ITS OBSERVERS -- a log string consumed by tooling is an API
  with no compiler behind it.** 2026-08-29. `[V]` `"host accepted client at slot"` appeared in **zero
  source files and seven probe scripts** (`mp.py`'s marker table as a slot-capturing regex, plus six
  probes). It was renamed by `9d0df17a` (2026-08-26), when a connecting stranger stopped spending a
  seat and "accepted" and "seated" genuinely stopped being the same event -- so the rename was
  RIGHT; the census was missing. Every one of those instruments read as "the host never accepted"
  from that day, and `p2p_smoke` printed a FAIL verdict while its own marker dump showed the client
  holding a peer slot. The same commit's smoke passed, because it asserts a DIFFERENT marker:
  coverage by one instrument says nothing about six others watching the same event. *Look FIRST:*
  `grep -rn "<the exact string>" tools/` before renaming a log line; when a scenario fails on an
  assertion nobody has exercised recently, verify the NEEDLE exists in `src/` before debugging the
  subject; and prefer a marker naming the EVENT over one naming the mechanism.

- **CLOSING A CONNECTION IS NOT RETIRING ITS STATE -- and the cost is per QUEUED PACKET, not per
  message.** 2026-08-29, post-ship audit on the b144 admission gate, then reproduced. Three
  individually-harmless facts multiply: `[V]` GNS delivers NO status callback for a connection YOU
  close (this project already knew it -- it is the documented reason `KickClaimed` replicates the whole
  teardown by hand), `[V]` the drain hands you up to 256 messages at once each carrying the user data
  it had at RECEIVE time, and `[V]` a `UE_LOGW` does a synchronous `fflush` under a lock the game
  thread shares (`log.cpp:225-227`, whose own comment records ~50/s "visibly tanking FPS"). So four
  refusal paths that called `CloseConnection` and returned left the band entry live, and every message
  of that peer already IN the batch re-entered and re-logged: **one junk burst from an unauthenticated
  peer = up to 256 disk syncs in a ~5 ms pass**, plus a 30 s state leak whose sweep then logged the
  wrong cause. **The pre-change code could not have this shape** -- the old gate ADMITTED on the first
  well-formed packet, so the state was consumed by the admission itself; adding a REFUSAL introduced
  the first path that closes without consuming, and refusal paths are the ones nobody exercises by
  hand. *Look FIRST:* make close-and-retire ONE function, and guard the handler's top by asking whether
  the entry still belongs to this connection (that guard also silences a straggler arriving after a
  SUCCESSFUL admission); when adding a refusal to something that previously only accepted, ask what
  consumed the state on the ACCEPT path; cost anything pre-auth per BATCH, not per message; and treat
  the log LEVEL as a performance decision, because a WARN on an attacker-paced path is an I/O
  amplifier. `memory/lesson_closing_a_connection_is_not_retiring_its_state.md`

- **A LENGTH-PREFIXED WIRE CHAIN HAS MORE THAN ONE WALKER, AND THE ERROR NAMES THE WRONG FIELD.**
  2026-08-29, caught by the smoke. Deleting the guid field from the Join payload broke EVERY join:
  `HandleJoinMessage`'s offsets were updated, but `ExtractJoinVersionFields` -- an independent,
  side-effect-free pre-pass over the same bytes in a sibling TU -- still walked TWO length-prefixed
  fields where one remained, read the flags byte as a length, overran and returned false. Both peers
  refused with *"malformed join (version field missing)"* and the smoke's verdict was *"client
  connected but never spawned the host puppet"* -- three symptoms, none naming the guid. **A chain
  walker only discovers it is lost when it runs out of buffer, which is at the END, so a field
  deleted in the MIDDLE is always reported as the FINAL field being absent.** *Look FIRST:* when
  adding/removing a wire FIELD, grep every walker of that payload before editing one (a second one
  usually lives in a sibling TU split out for a gate or pre-pass); read a "field X missing" error on
  the last field of a chain as "something earlier moved". Both walkers now name each other in
  comments -- no compiler can express "these two parse the same bytes". This is the FIELD analogue of
  `feedback_reliablekind_router_checklist`.
  `memory/lesson_a_length_prefixed_chain_has_more_than_one_walker.md`

- **A GATE THAT CHECKS NAMES HAS NOT CHECKED CONTENTS -- and it is loudest about what matters least.**
  2026-08-26, found by a post-ship audit. `Test-PackageZip` refused wrapped roots, missing manifests,
  illegal names and suffixed versions -- every check presence-by-NAME -- and **read not one byte of
  `mod/dlls/main.dll`**, so a zero-byte or non-PE payload passed all of them and the packager printed
  `PACKAGE OK`. The contrast is inside the same commit: `Get-PngDimensions` was written to re-measure
  `icon.png` under the comment *"re-MEASURE it, never trust the filename"* -- applied to a 123 KB
  decoration and not to the 17 MB artifact the package exists to deliver. `[V]` `UE4SS_ARC` §7.9
  already records this project shipping wrong bytes once, from *"a payload picked by mtime"*. **The
  blind spot is invisible from inside the gate**: every test you would naturally write against a name
  check is a test about names, so its drill passed with 7 RED arms, none seeding a bad payload. *Look
  FIRST:* list what the gate OPENS vs what it merely NAMES -- everything in the second column is an
  unchecked assumption; and reject the tempting fix, a size floor, because a threshold is a guess and
  a truncated download still starts with `MZ`. The arbitrary-number-free legs are non-empty + magic
  bytes, plus an EXACT sha whenever the caller knows what it handed in.
  `memory/lesson_a_gate_that_checks_names_has_not_checked_contents.md`

- **IF THE ACCEPTANCE TEST *CONSUMES* AN ARTIFACT, THAT ARTIFACT IS A PRECONDITION -- NOT THE
  DELIVERABLE IT LOOKS LIKE.** 2026-08-26. The user's push gate was "tested manually AND via
  r2modman"; their ordering words were *"Сначала доделать, потом zip"*, and the first design duly put
  packaging last. `[V]` But `UE4SS_ARC` §7.8 + `THUNDERSTORE.md`'s checklist define that control as
  r2modman's **"Import local mod"**, which takes a **ZIP** -- so with no zip the gate could never
  lift, hands-on being closed left no human path either, and **the plan's last step was the input to
  the gate that authorised the plan.** Not merely a worse order: unsatisfiable by construction, and
  invisible from inside the work because every step of it would have succeeded. *Look FIRST:* write
  the acceptance test's INPUTS down before ordering the work, and read a user gate as a contract with
  inputs rather than as a milestone. **And look for two referents before overriding anyone** -- "zip"
  meant both the artifact (a precondition) and the irreversible Thunderstore upload (genuinely last,
  and the user confirmed it stays last), so splitting the word satisfied both the rule and the request.

- **A STANDING AUDIT RULE OUTRANKS A SESSION-LEVEL AGENT BAN -- WHEN TWO INSTRUCTIONS COLLIDE, THE
  ONE THAT BUYS EVIDENCE WINS.** USER RULE 2026-08-26, verbatim: *"Audit agents for shipped code is
  an exception to the 'don't spawn agents unasked' rule."* Born from a real miss the same day: a
  session shipped a **live use-after-free** fix in the teardown path (`42af8cc0`) and handed off with
  the post-ship audit *flagged as not run*, reasoning that the session instruction *"Do not call the
  AgentTool unless the user requested it"* forbade it. The reasoning was symmetrical and wrong --
  `[[feedback-post-ship-audit]]` IS the user asking, once, as a project rule, so an audit agent on
  shipped code is never "unasked". Flagging beat skipping silently, but the resolution still cost the
  riskiest change of the session its only independent reviewer. **The asymmetry: an unaudited ship
  has no observer at all, so the failure is invisible rather than loud** -- the same shape as
  `[[lesson-an-untestable-path-hides-more-than-its-residual]]`. *Look FIRST:* when a session-level
  restriction appears to forbid a standing project rule, ask which instruction PRODUCES EVIDENCE and
  which merely withholds it, and do not treat "do less" as automatically the conservative choice. And
  note the exception NAMES ITS BOUNDARY: it covers agents reviewing built/committed/deployed code
  only -- **design agents stay forbidden** (`[[feedback-no-design-architect-agents]]`), and
  `Workflow`/deep-research stay opt-in. `memory/feedback_post_ship_audit.md`

- **AN ESTIMATE USED TO *DECLINE* WORK IS A MEASUREMENT YOU OWE.** 2026-08-26, twice in one design
  pass and in OPPOSITE directions, each time as the reason to build the second-best option. (1) I
  called separating the connection routing key from the player seat *"a tree-wide signature change --
  every handler takes a `senderSlot`"*; `[V]` `session.cpp:463` says in its own comment *"HandleMessage
  has exactly ONE caller (the drain loop below)"* -- the slot is derived at ONE site. (2) I called
  splitting `kMaxPeers` *"500 uses across 108 files, too big"*; `[V]` classifying those 500 shows 56
  comments and nearly all the rest are `std::array<T, kMaxPeers>` sizes and `slot >= kMaxPeers` bounds
  checks that KEEP `kMaxPeers` under a split -- the sites carrying "how many PLAYERS may sit" are
  **5-8**. A critic demanded the measurement both times and it reversed the decision both times. This
  is the enforcement gap under *scope is never a reason to hold back*: I was not refusing on scope, I
  was **mis-measuring** scope and then honestly following my own bad number, and a rule against holding
  back cannot bite when the size input is invented. **The asymmetry that makes it dangerous: a wrong
  "too big" is self-concealing, because the build that would have refuted it never happens.** *Look
  FIRST:* a raw `grep -c` counts mentions, not the refactor -- classify before you cite, and state both
  ("500 mentions, of which N carry the meaning that changes"); read the tree's own comments before
  estimating blast radius (both answers were written in the source by a previous session); and prefer a
  deferral that names a VALUE over one that names a cost -- the seat split was finally deferred because
  the shipped fix removed its security value, which survives scrutiny, where "500 uses" did not.

- **A safety constraint added to a spike can BLIND the measurement, and the resulting PASS/FAIL is a
  fact about the constraint.** 2026-08-25: a `/qf` round correctly noticed that RUNG 1 of the native-UI
  probe WRITES into VOTV's live `ui_menu_C::switcher_widgets` — at our index ESC is a no-op and a
  throwaway has no `button_back`, so a hold left open strands the player — and hardened it to *"restore
  the index and `RemoveChild` in the SAME tick"*. `[V]` Slate lays out AFTER a `ProcessEvent` observer
  returns, so a same-tick restore presents no frame with the widget active and leaves
  `GetDesiredSize()` reading the same `(0,0)` it read before: the spike **always** reports "did not
  render", on a build where it does. Run as written it would have killed the 12th-child placement on
  false evidence; held for a 2,200 ms deadline it read `(623,39)` and RENDERS. *Look FIRST:* when you
  harden a spike, re-ask what it can still OBSERVE — and bound the exposure by a deadline the
  instrument owns (restore only if the state is still yours; tear down on the edge that would make it
  dangerous) rather than by shrinking the window to zero.
  `memory/lesson_a_safety_constraint_can_blind_the_measurement.md`

- **A counter over a memoised, cross-thread predicate counts the REFRESH, not the phenomenon — and it
  lies hardest in exactly the window you are investigating.** 2026-08-25: counting presented frames by
  `world_identity::CurrentWorldKind()` from the Present detour gave `unknown=571` of 1103 — and `[V]`
  **every one was a STALE sample** (`fresh=0`), because the memo is written only by a game-thread
  caller and `GT::Post` drains inside `ProcessEvent`, which barely runs at boot. "No world existed" and
  "we had not yet measured whether one did" were one bucket, and only the first is evidence about what
  a UMG surface could have drawn. Two sub-traps, both real: stamping "refreshed" when you QUEUE the
  refresh makes the stale bucket permanently empty (two stamps are needed — the queue stamp gates the
  post cadence so a blocked game thread does not accumulate a task per frame; the ran stamp is
  staleness), and a zero-initialised stamp is *never refreshed*, not "0 ms ago". *Look FIRST:* any
  predicate read across threads is a memo — ask who writes it, on which thread, and what stops that
  writer during the window that matters; then bucket staleness beside the value. **SEQUEL, same day:**
  the first fix bucketed "we had not started yet" on `GT::TasksRun() == 0` and read **zero** while 478
  frames sat stale, because boot drains tasks before the first present — **HAS-EVER-RUN and
  IS-RUNNING-NOW are different questions and only the second describes a window.** Keyed on the
  counter's ADVANCE instead, the window resolved at once and became the answer to the whole rung:
  `[V]` **~540 frames over ~11.4 s at every launch with the pump not advancing at all.** A monotonic
  counter's VALUE answers "ever"; its DELTA answers "now". Liveness is always a delta.
  `memory/lesson_a_counter_over_a_cross_thread_memo_counts_the_refresh.md`

- **A list narrowed for DISPLAY, reused as a PREDICATE, fails closed and reads as a finding.**
  2026-08-25: `mp.py`'s nativeui verdict built `lines = [ln for ln in log if "[native_ui_probe]" in ln]`
  so it could echo the probe's own output, then defined `find(needle)` over that same list and asserted
  `find("menutravel: MENU-SHOT READY")`. `menutravel:` is another subsystem's tag, so the needle was
  structurally absent and the branch was a constant — it reported *"transition failed / hung"* through
  two runs whose logs plainly showed `MENU-SHOT READY` and `DONE`. Cost two 4-minute runs and sent the
  investigation at a launch-argument theory. The narrowing was written for a good reason, in a
  different part of the function, behind a helper whose name says nothing about its corpus. *Look
  FIRST:* two corpora, two helpers (`find` vs `find_any`); **any assert whose needle does not contain
  the filter's own token is a bug by construction** — a mechanical check, not a judgement; and confirm
  a runner's reported failure in the RAW artifact before acting on it.
  `memory/lesson_a_list_narrowed_for_display_reused_as_a_predicate.md`
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-26:** an assert searched for `hidden (ESC` and the selftest's OWN
  instruction line contained the literal `'hidden (ESC...)'` -- **the predicate matched the
  sentence describing what it was looking for**, and printed ALL PASS while the feature did
  nothing. It hid a second bug: `keybd_event` down+up in ONE tick is invisible to a per-tick
  `GetAsyncKeyState` poll. Never let a log line quote the string its own assert searches for;
  hold a synthesized key across ticks; and distrust a selftest that passes on its first run.

- **2026-08-26 — test the assumption the whole plan rests on FIRST, not last.** An eight-step browser
  plan built a scroll drive, preserved a scroll offset and decided a row model -- three steps that are
  *entirely* about scrolling -- while scheduling *"does the wheel scroll this widget at all"* LAST,
  inside the harness. `[V]` at the time NOTHING in `ui/server_browser_native.cpp` touched a scroll API
  and no wheel event had ever reached it; and **no step anywhere priced "make it scroll" if the
  answer was no**. *(Both halves of that measurement have since moved and the takeaway is what
  survives: T0 RAN on 2026-08-26 and the answer is YES -- `WHEEL VERDICT YES`, re-asserted every
  browser run -- and the scroll API now IS called from production, by the offset preservation in
  `ui/server_browser_rows.cpp`. The row is kept because the ORDERING mistake it records is the
  lesson; do not read its `[V]` as current.)* The
  plan was ordered by BUILD DEPENDENCY, which is reasonable and which structurally cannot see BLAST
  RADIUS. Two aggravators: the test as first written **could not run** (at ~2 live lobbies the list does
  not overflow the viewport, so there is no scrollbar), and it lacked the **positive control** three
  other steps had -- an unchanged screenshot is three-way ambiguous between *the wheel never arrived*,
  *the ScrollBox does not scroll* and *the capture beat Slate's layout*. *Look FIRST:* order steps by
  "how many later steps become waste if this is false", not by convenience; if the answer being NO has
  no step, say so IN the plan; check the cheap test is RUNNABLE before calling it cheap; and when some
  steps say "shown RED first", ask which ones do not -- that asymmetry is the visible symptom.

- **Your own memory file can silently EDIT the plan of record, and you will read it back as the plan.**
  2026-08-25: on "go next" I was one call from implementing a security root (A54). `[V]` The design doc
  of record ordered `A52 -> B3 -> B4 -> checklist`; A52 had shipped, so B3 was next -- and B3/B4 are the
  user's own two remaining reported symptoms. The only thing putting A54 next was a memory entry I wrote
  in the previous session, which promoted it to position 2 **without ever saying it was displacing
  anything**. A memory NEXT feels identical to the plan's NEXT, because carrying NEXT is exactly what
  memory is for. *Look FIRST:* when memory and the design doc both say what is next, the DOC wins and
  the disagreement is itself the finding; and when WRITING a memory NEXT that reorders, say that it
  reorders. If the displaced items are things the user reported and can still SEE, the burden is
  entirely on the reordering. `memory/lesson_your_own_memory_file_can_edit_the_plan_of_record.md`
- **A throttled log line is not an event count** -- `grep -c` gave 12 where the emitter's own
  carried counter showed ~801 (`pile_spawn_bind.cpp:151`, `count < 8 || count % 200 == 0`).
  RETIRED as its own row 2026-08-26 (RULE 2, it was a near-twin): folded into the
  instrument-answers-a-narrower-question row in section 4, which carries this as one of three
  instances plus the log-counting procedure.

- **PIN AN OUTSIDE REPORTER'S BUILD TO A COMMIT BEFORE YOU DIAGNOSE THEIR LOG.** 2026-08-26, the
  project's first external bug report (excellent paired host/client logs, 28k lines). I censused,
  traced and built two theories before reading the build banner: `b134, compiled Aug 23 15:45:38`,
  PR base `63eb699c`. `[V]` `git merge-base --is-ancestor 65fccd70 63eb699c` = **NO** -- their build
  predates the commit whose message reads "client eid-only clump broadcasts 871 -> 0" and cites "940
  in the field". **An ABSENT marker is weak evidence -- find the POSITIVE CONTROL.** `[V]` in their
  log: `CLIENT suppressed KEYED` **2169** (the older v107 suppression IS present) vs `CLIENT
  suppressed eid-only` **0** vs the pre-fix `broadcasting DESTROY (eid-only: trash clump)` **956** --
  and both suppressed-strings come from ONE `UE_LOGI` (`prop_destroy_seam.cpp:137`, `%s = keyless ?
  "eid-only" : "KEYED"`), so the seam ran thousands of times and never took the keyless branch. Proof,
  not inference; the fix commit's own "2,172x suppressed KEYED" cross-checks their 2169. Internally this never
  bites because you built the DLL you are debugging; the moment outside reports arrive, every log
  comes from an unknown point in history, and the best reports come from users who build from
  source. Pinning the build is also what SEPARATED the already-fixed half from the still-open half
  (host 3256 vs client 4293 live keyed props, `claimed only 0` on a snapshot that arrived COMPLETE --
  not explained by that fix); without it both would have shipped as one finding and the fixed half
  would have discredited the open one. *Look FIRST:* banner -> pin to a commit -> `git log
  <base>..main -- <subsystem>` -> for each candidate fix find its POST-FIX MARKER in their log (its
  ABSENCE is the proof, and it beats reasoning about dates across timezones -- theirs +0300, mine
  +0600, the naive comparison said the fix was in) -> only then diagnose.

- **A NEW WAY TO ENTER OR LEAVE A STATE OWES A CENSUS OF EVERYTHING THAT READS THE TRANSITION.**
  2026-08-26, fixing a contributor's ATV seat gate: I added a tie-break where the higher slot YIELDS
  pose authority while still seated. Two lines, local, no new state. `[V]` `atv_sync.cpp`'s existing
  authority-lost edge assumed the only way to lose authority was to dismount, so it cleared
  `occupantSlot` and broadcast `AtvRelease` -- against a yield BOTH are wrong: clearing the slot
  erases the winner's claim and `IsLocalOccupant` is still true, so we re-claim next tick and flap
  permanently; and the release re-enables physics on the ATV the winner is driving. My "safe two-line
  fix" would have shipped a WORSE defect than the one it fixed. Review cannot catch it: the broken
  code is UNCHANGED and never appears in the diff -- the defect exists only in the composition.
  *Look FIRST:* when a change adds a new way for an ownership/authority predicate to flip, grep every
  read of that predicate AND of the fields the transition touches, and ask per site "does this code
  assume WHY it flipped?" If yes it needs the REASON, not the edge -- give it a discriminator rather
  than letting one edge mean two things. Then hand-trace one full tick of the new path; that is what
  found this.

- **An instrument can be blind FOUR different ways in one design pass, and reasoning catches none of
  them.** 2026-08-25, B3: (1) a seam the module's own header records as never having fired; (2) a seam
  field-counted at 5 host vs 19 client lines over DISJOINT entities; (3) a reader that shares its offset
  with the code under test, so a wrong read prints AGREEMENT; (4) a read off the actor's ROOT component
  when the bytecode names a different one -- null on both peers, agreeing by construction. Three are one
  root (sampling the wrong population); the fourth is "the instrument is a mirror". The bitter part:
  `coingun_collect.cpp:317` cites the parent lesson BY NAME, and instrument #1 would have gone four
  lines below it -- a lesson filed as a fact about one seam does not fire as a question about a new one.
  *Look FIRST:* `grep -c` the seam in a real log on BOTH peers before instrumenting it (0 = never fires;
  differing counts = ask whether they cover the same entities); then ask what the instrument reads that
  the code under test does not -- if "nothing", it cannot fail.

- **The user's own words live in the session TRANSCRIPTS, not in the doc tree -- and an absence
  asserted from a search that missed the source is not evidence.** 2026-08-25, B4: I spent four `/qf`
  rounds on the premise that symptom 3 had no user statement, because the sentence existed only in two
  files I had written. `[V]` The verbatim report was in `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/a5910741-....jsonl`
  at `2026-08-24T11:31:35Z` the whole time -- *"клиент нажал выйти в главное меню ... а в игре хоста он
  всё ещё стоял на месте бесконечно.(HOST + CLIENT_1)"* -- carrying the exit path, the peers, the
  duration, and the user's own FALSE belief that they had disconnected. My paraphrase had discarded all
  four. That false absence nearly justified dropping a real, field-observed bug, and it was the FIFTH
  self-authored line read back as evidence in one investigation (the others: a pawn measurement
  transferred onto a world; a code comment whose first word is literally "ASSUMPTION", promoted into a
  licence to delete two tests; and a tracker row nearly cited as a licence to build something already
  shipped). Three of the five happened AFTER the pattern was named in the same session.
  *Look FIRST:* filter the project's `*.jsonl` for `type=="user"` and grep `message.content[].text`
  before writing "the user never said X" or quoting the user at all -- a doc is a paraphrase of
  testimony, never testimony. And a load-bearing sentence needs a PROVENANCE (measured on what, by
  whom, on the same object?), not a citation.

- **A counter downstream of a re-transmitter measures the re-transmitter, not the source.** 2026-08-25:
  `pose-diag ... fresh=61/s` was read as "the client's producer is running", and a whole host-side
  design was deleted on it. `[V]` `isNew` (`session_streams.cpp:103`) compares a stamp bumped per
  ARRIVING PACKET, and `hasLocal_` has NO false path anywhere in the tree (4 hits: set at
  `session_streams.cpp:44`, cleared only at session Start `session_start.cpp:153`), so the net thread
  re-sends the last sample forever whether or not the game thread still produces. A live stationary
  client prints the identical line -- measured in the same session's own smoke,
  `fresh=61/s targetSpeed=0 trail=0cm`. Two more overloaded numbers bit the same pass: `bank<=1356 ms`
  in the movement ledger rises on ANY sender-clock lag (a hitch, a level teardown), and a "44+ s"
  figure measured on a dead PAWN was applied to a dead WORLD.
  *Look FIRST:* find the line that INCREMENTS the counter and name the mechanism driving it, then ask
  "what else produces this exact number?" If a re-transmitter sits between source and counter, the
  answer is "the re-transmitter, indefinitely". Corollary: **a has-data latch with no false path IS a
  re-transmitter** -- grep the setter's call sites for a `false` argument.
  `memory/lesson_a_counter_downstream_of_a_retransmitter.md`

- **When the lab cannot reproduce the field, build the knob that FORCES the field's condition -- an
  acceptance test that already passes cannot show your fix works.** 2026-08-25, B4: a user reported a
  client that quit to the menu standing on the host "infinitely", and the scenario that drives exactly
  that (`mp.py wirewindow`) PASSED on the broken build, twice. For several rounds that was read as
  evidence the bug did not exist. The mechanism was real but CONDITIONAL: `registry_reaper` revalidated
  its cached world with `IsLiveByIndex`, which tests slot-occupancy + `Unreachable|PendingKill` only, so
  the flee could not fire until the dying world was flagged -- `[V]` ~5 s here (`liveWorlds` 1->2->1),
  evidently never in the field. The unblock was a one-line dev knob (`VOTVCOOP_REAPER_PIN_WORLD=1`)
  pinning that cache so the window is infinite: RED = 11 pose flushes at ~60/s, 3 leaked reliables, no
  flee, slot never freed -- the report reproduced exactly, including the `fresh=61/s` the whole
  investigation had argued about; GREEN = 2 flushes, flee at +1 s, slot emptied. Same command, only the
  build differing.
  *Look FIRST:* if the acceptance test passes on the build you believe is broken, do not conclude the
  bug is absent and do not hunt a second root -- ask which term in your mechanism is ENVIRONMENTAL and
  pin it. The tell is your own words "only if" / "depending on timing" / "on a slower machine": those
  name the knob. And exclude the other side by measurement first -- a hard-killed client PROCESS freed
  the host slot in +11.1 s via GNS's own timeout, retiring a competing hypothesis that had survived
  three rounds of argument. The knob retires with the mechanism (RULE 2); the RED table is the durable
  artifact. (Applied end-to-end to fix B's `VOTVCOOP_PE_IMMUNE_RELAY=0` on 2026-08-28: RED table
  written at `UE4SS_ARC.md` §4d — the knob reproduced the field crash with a byte-identical dump
  hash — then the knob retired in the same commit.)

- **When a boolean becomes THREE-valued, every `!` is a bug candidate -- and writing the rule in a
  header does not make you follow it.** 2026-08-25, B4: the diff introduced
  `WorldKind {Unknown, Gameplay, Other}` and stated the rule in the header it was adding -- *"a gate
  that STARTS something wants positive Gameplay, a gate that ENDS something wants positive Other, and
  neither may fire on Unknown"*. Nine comparisons were then written; eight were positive and correct,
  and **the one that was wrong was the only negation**: `if (!inGameplayWorld) SetInPurgeEpisode(false)`
  ends the episode, and `!Gameplay` is true for Unknown. Not theoretical -- a travel publishes Unknown
  for ~1 s and inside an episode the module cancels its own 4 s throttle, so it cleared a LIVE episode
  in ~16 ms and skipped the whole episode-END block (deleter flush, dead-key drain, re-seed, re-bind,
  client re-announce). Three of the nine sites were authored AFTER the header sentence, same sitting.
  *Look FIRST:* the moment a bool becomes three-valued, **grep the diff for `!` and `? :` on the
  projection variable** and re-derive each from all three cases -- that grep finds it in seconds where
  reading for sense does not. Better: keep the enum at the use site, or derive TWO bools so nothing
  has to negate. The projection is what makes the third value invisible.

- **Grep the field logs before declaring a measurement impossible — then separate the SERIES inside
  them.** 2026-08-25: asked for a distribution of real per-pose deltas, I answered that it "does not
  exist on disk (poses are never logged, by design)" — and in the same pass derived a world diameter
  from coordinates found in those same logs. `pos diag:` prints `local actor=` **and** `puppet world=`
  at 0.5 Hz; **808 player samples** were sitting in the 2026-08-24 logs the whole time, and they carried
  the entire distribution the design needed (host local max **692 cm/s**, puppet max **606**, exactly
  one discontinuity in 11.5 minutes). The second half is the sharper one: the first extraction mixed
  those samples with `[WA-TRACE]` prop coordinates and one pre-join sample from the client's *preLoad
  world*, producing a "2.34 km world diameter" that was wrong twice over — the two players never left a
  **35 m patch**, and the world's real diagonal (**~5.53 km**) comes from the level dumps with the
  engine sentinels filtered. **Look here FIRST:** grep the logs for the noun and for the subsystem's
  own name, then label every series before computing anything over it.

- **AN EQUIVALENCE INSTRUMENT THAT STRIPS COMMENTS CANNOT SEE A COMMENT DELETED — AND YOUR OWN
  MUTATE CONTROLS WILL NOT TELL YOU.** 2026-08-25, the `a290a466` coingun extraction. `[MEASURED]`
  The commit claimed all three moved bodies *"line-for-line identical modulo four substitutions"* and
  cited four mutate controls shown RED first. An independent re-diff found **six** differences,
  including a **3-line comment DELETION** in `OnCollectPre` and a 2->3-line structural rewrite. The
  normalizer did `ln.split('//')[0]` then dropped now-empty lines, so a deleted comment was invisible
  BY CONSTRUCTION — and all four controls were CODE mutations (flip a gate, neuter a check, delete a
  code line, change a constant), i.e. exactly the class the normalizer was built to keep. Controls and
  normalizer came from the same head in the same ten minutes, so the blindness could not be discovered
  by the controls. No behavioural difference existed; the overclaim is the defect, in a lane whose
  defining failure is false comments.
  **LOOK HERE FIRST:** (1) never write "line-for-line identical" about a NORMALIZED compare — state the
  blind set in the commit ("compares CODE only; comment/whitespace changes are invisible"); (2) write
  one control **per normalizer rule**, not per failure you imagine — every strip/replace/regex is a
  blindness you chose and owes a control that proves it is no wider than intended; (3) for a pure move
  also run a raw `diff -u` and read the hunks, which needs no normalizer and is what actually finds a
  dropped comment; (4) a third party re-running your comparison beats another control you write
  yourself — brief them "report ANY difference, including ones the substitutions would explain; I want
  your list, not my list".

- **A VERDICT THAT ALREADY PASSES ON THE BROKEN BUILD MEASURES NOTHING — two of four did, and it took
  27 rounds to notice.** 2026-08-24, `/qf` rounds 42-44. `[MEASURED]` Verdict 2 was *"a client picks up
  a host coin and the HOST's balance moves by that coin's denomination"* — satisfied by the **unfixed**
  build: `HOST/…/multivoid.log:32118` retires coin 6182 (`PE-invisible self-destroy`) and `:32119` is
  `balance_sync: host Points -> 350`, **+1 in v137**, because *the host collected its own coin*
  (`HOST:32117` carries `grab_hook[InpActEvt.use]` one line earlier — attribution, not adjacency).
  Verdict 1 (*"both peers agree on the coin set"*) passed **vacuously**: a client sale was refused 3/3,
  so it compared **two empty sets**. Verdict 4 had the same shape one level down — the CDO default
  `points = 5` renders bronze, so a **1-point** coin is accidentally correct on a mirror.
  A related trap in the same family: verdict 1's original wording measured a **collect**, because
  `[V]` **a sale does not credit at all** — `sell` mints coins worth the price and the balance moves
  only when one is collected (`HOST:28763` mint, no movement; `HOST:29410` +25 on the dead-retire) — so
  it would have FAILED on a perfectly correct sale lane.
  **LOOK HERE FIRST:** before trusting any acceptance verdict, run it against the FAILING build's own
  logs and ask three questions in order — (1) does it already pass? (2) can it pass *vacuously* (empty
  set, coinciding default, no-op)? (3) does it measure MY axis or a neighbouring one? Prefer an
  **attribution read** over an instruction to the tester ("a credit with no host use-press in the
  preceding N ms") — the field run violated the instruction by accident. And note the dual: splitting
  verdicts for clean attribution can leave the **user's actual criterion** tested by no rung at all;
  keep one composite ACCEPTANCE verdict alongside the diagnostic ones. Full:
  `memory/lesson_a_verdict_that_already_passes_on_the_broken_build.md`.

- **THE FAIL-SAFE YOU ADD TO REMOVE AN ASSUMPTION CAN ITSELF BE FAIL-OPEN.** 2026-08-24, `/qf` round 38.
  A mirror-park owner was given "read `bSimulatePhysics` before writing, and skip components already
  false" precisely so it would stop *assuming* which components simulate. `[MEASURED]` but
  `bSimulatePhysics` is **not** a `UPrimitiveComponent` property — it is a packed bitfield on
  `FBodyInstanceCore` (`PhysicsCore.hpp:8`, seven `uint8` all at `0x0010`) reached only via
  `UPrimitiveComponent::BodyInstance` (`Engine.hpp:1011`) — so `FindPropertyOffset(primClass,
  L"bSimulatePhysics")` returns **-1**, which "skip if already false" reads as **already false**: the
  owner would have skipped every component and parked **nothing**, silently, in the one commit two of
  the four reported symptoms rested on. **LOOK HERE FIRST:** when adding a read-before-write guard, ask
  what the guard does when the READ FAILS, and make that branch do the guarded ACTION, not skip it —
  the purpose is to park, so failing to park *is* the defect and the read is only an optimisation.
  Read a bitfield via **`FindBoolProperty`** (`reflection.h:299`), never `FindPropertyOffset`.
  *(Pointer corrected 2026-08-29: this row named `FindBoolFieldBits` at `reflection.h:277-290`;
  that symbol exists NOWHERE in the tree and those lines are `EnumerateStructFields`. The
  takeaway was always right, the pointer sent the next session at a dead symbol.)*

- **2026-08-24 — STANDING USER RULE: scope is NEVER a reason to hold back.** Verbatim: *"Я даю зеленый
  свет даже на самые радикальные решения, если они окажутся верными и правильными."* This is the
  standing form of RULE 1's per-request green light — it does not need re-asking. Dissolving a module,
  inverting a shared primitive's default across hundreds of call sites, retiring a shipped lane whole,
  changing how the GAME behaves: none of these is a reason to design something smaller. The operative
  test: **a design that is second-best because the best was judged too big has NOT converged.** The
  boundary is the user's own wording — *"верными и правильными"* — so the licence covers SCOPE and
  BEHAVIOUR only and never a skipped measurement, a skipped audit, or a shipped bug. Now enforced
  mechanically: `.claude/skills/qf/SKILL.md` carries it in the critic prompt, in the brief assembly
  (name every option you rejected for being large), and as a convergence condition.
  *Look FIRST:* when you write "X would be the right fix, but it would mean rewriting Y", X is the live
  option and Y's size is not an argument.
  `memory/feedback_scope_is_never_a_reason_to_hold_back.md`
- **2026-08-24 — RUN A NEW DECISION RULE ON ITS OWN MOTIVATING CASE, BEFORE YOU COMMIT IT.** I wrote a three-step test for the act-as-host rule (`COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md` §2b) and committed it (`d5d56eac`) without running it on the **sell gun** — the case the user raised to motivate the whole rule. A `/qf` critic asked me to walk it out loud and it **could not decide that case**: the deciding question, *can the arbiter OBSERVE the trigger?*, was not one of the three steps, so the test returned "build it" for something that cannot be built until the `0x45` `vm_dispatch` substrate lands (`[V]` all 19 credit sites are `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`). Added as step 2 in `b007dac0`. **The missing step is usually the important one — the motivating case is motivating BECAUSE it is hard, so a procedure validated only on easy cases encodes the easy questions.** *Look FIRST:* before committing any rule/test/checklist/taxonomy, execute it verbatim in writing on the originating example AND on a case it should REJECT; if the motivating case is still being measured, that is a reason to WAIT, not to commit and revise (I revised twice in one session). `memory/feedback_run_a_new_decision_rule_on_its_own_motivating_case.md`
- **2026-08-24 — If the fix GROWS every round, you have not found the root yet.** Across a 9-round
  `/qf` the W10 fix accreted a per-sender share cap, a full per-connection drain, a shared-drain
  pause, a `FatalCloseSlot` terminal, an hConn-stamped connection park with counters, and a
  largest-contributor rule — **every one designed, defended, then discarded** — before converging on
  *moving one existing check above a role split*, with no new constant and a net-negative diff. Each
  intermediate design was locally defensible (it answered the previous round's objection), which is
  exactly what makes the pattern invisible from inside: accretion feels like progress. Complexity
  growth is a free per-round proxy for "the root is still mis-stated" — and it was: the register had
  named a fairness bug when the defect was one-role-only backpressure. *Look FIRST:* state the fix's
  SIZE in every `/qf` brief (lines, new constants, new state, new API surface); two consecutive
  rounds of growth means stop designing and go re-derive what the defect IS in mechanism terms; four
  or more discarded mechanisms is the same signal. And when a fix does converge small, name the
  discarded designs in the commit so the next session does not re-propose them.
  **SHARPENED 2026-08-24 with its counter-case: shrinking is a SIGNAL, not a PROOF, and the failure
  runs in this direction too.** v137's impl `/qf` deleted a suppression, a heal and a whole refusal
  branch in one round and treated the shrink as validation; the justification ("a refusal then degrades
  to exactly today's behaviour") was FALSE BY CONSTRUCTION, because the client's suppression of its own
  artifacts was unconditional while the authorization was conditional and decided later — the field
  found it as a total loss. The follow-up pass then deleted the same suppression a SECOND time on
  arguments that, re-derived, only showed it was unnecessary on the HAPPY path. *Look FIRST, on a
  sudden shrink:* which branch just disappeared, and was it load-bearing on the FAILURE path? A fix
  that shrinks by deleting the failure branch has stopped modelling failure, not converged.
  **AND THE ORIGINAL DIRECTION, INSTANCED 2026-08-24 (`/qf` 46-47):** round 46 answered a cross-module
  verb-identity defect with a **cross-cutting `.inc` id ratchet touching every consumer**; round 47
  measured that the substrate **already owned a globally unique handle and simply was not publishing
  it** (`RegisterVirtualVerb` requires the verb NAME to have static lifetime; the table stores that
  pointer), collapsing the fix to ~4 lines plus the one offending consumer. **The tell was the shape,
  before any measurement: the fix's blast radius exceeded the defect's** — one module misreading one
  value. And the ratchet would not have been one: **an `.inc` of ints makes duplicates impossible only
  if the registration signature becomes TYPED**, else it is convention wearing a ratchet's hat. ASK, when
  a fix grows: *what does the substrate already own that is unique by construction?* — the answer is
  often in the registration path, unpublished.

- **Your own session-end SUMMARY is a free measurement — read it before arguing mechanism.** 2026-08-24
  (`/qf` 46-47). A kerfur gate defect was traced correctly (`av.active` is true for ANY registered verb,
  so a foreign bracket inverts the gates) and elevated to **"SIXTH live shipped defect, ordered STRICTLY
  BEFORE any new verb registration"** on that reasoning alone. `[V]` Both field logs already carried the
  verdict, printed by that same module at `OnDisconnect`: `[kerfur_asm] CONTAINMENT SUMMARY
  (session-end): catch{off=0 on=0} ... otherIn=6/7` — **zero conversions in the whole run**, so the
  defect was latent; and `otherIn=6/7` further showed the bracket window WAS live with every in-window
  spawn correctly class-rejected. The log had been read for several rounds — but **by searching for the
  SYMPTOM** (the coin's eid, the credit lines, the drive traces), and a session-end summary sits at the
  END, one line, answering a question nobody had asked. LOOK FIRST: before writing "live shipped defect"
  or ordering work on urgency, grep the artifacts for the module's own counters (`SUMMARY`,
  `session-end`, `STATS`, `GATES`, `containment`) — this project dumps them at `OnDisconnect` precisely
  so a run can never end having measured nothing, and that investment is wasted unread. **Grep for your
  SUBSYSTEM'S name, not only for the symptom.**
  `memory/lesson_your_own_session_end_summary_is_a_free_measurement.md`

- **An instrument must report its INPUTS, not only its verdict.** 2026-07-31: one probe printed
  `PREDICATE DEAD` on four consecutive runs for four UNRELATED reasons — it targeted a class default
  object; then a widget-tree template (filtering only the immediate outer removed 3 of 400, because a
  template's immediate outer is a `UWidgetTree` exactly like a live instance's); then an off-screen
  widget where `SetKeyboardFocus` is a no-op; and only then the right one, where the verdict became a
  real finding. Separately a key probe fired on `WM_MOUSEMOVE` (the swallow `switch` shares one body
  across mouse and key cases), and a control-matrix run was invalidated wholesale because a
  PowerShell helper stole foreground, VOTV auto-paused, and `pause=1` answered every question first.
  **Every one was caught by a field the probe printed about ITSELF** — what it targeted, how many
  candidates survived each filter, which message kind it saw, and the ambient state
  (`[capture=1 chat=0 pause=1]`). **Look FIRST: `focused=0` is exactly what a CORRECT probe prints on
  an idle game, so a verdict-only instrument makes "my selection logic is broken" and "the feature
  does not work" byte-identical — and confirmation bias picks the second. Print the subject and the
  population (`instances=327 focused=0`), assert the precondition inside the run, and treat every
  helper that touches global UI state as a confound.**
  Full: `[[lesson-an-instrument-must-report-its-inputs-not-only-its-verdict]]`.
  **NEW MEMBER 2026-08-24 (security W10).** W10 deleted the host's silent reliable DROP and put a receive PAUSE in its place — and the pause was **silent on both roles**: nothing logged when it fired, nothing logged how deep the inbox got. The owed RED drill was therefore blind BY CONSTRUCTION, since "no pause fired" and "the depth never got there" print identically. Fixed `0de1c1dc`: an exact enqueue-side depth high-water plus per-trigger counters (depth vs apply-park, kept SEPARATE so a seeds-arc park can never be misread as a depth pause), every ~1 Hz **including the quiet case**. Second-order: the drill's THRESHOLD is now chosen FROM the measurement rather than guessed, which is why the drill knob was deliberately left unbuilt in the same commit.

- **A DECLINED PRODUCT QUESTION DOES NOT GO AWAY — it just gets answered after you build it
  (2026-07-30).** The `/qf` critic asked in **round 1** and again in **round 2** whether the homoglyph
  fold was a product choice for the user. I declined both times, citing "never ask when the
  least-crutches option is obvious", and ran 13 more rounds. The design converged — 444 measured pairs,
  both drills RED, a four-peer lobby proving it end to end — and the user's answer was *"I don't care
  if Alex and Аlex play together"* / *"Alex (latin) and Аlex (cyrillic) is normal"*. Built and reverted
  the same session. The autonomy rule covers **HOW** to build, never **WHETHER the user wants the
  outcome**. **Look FIRST: before a design pass, answer "whose complaint is this?" — if the answer is
  "mine", spend one sentence in text and keep working while it sits. A critic naming something
  product-feel TWICE is a stop condition, not a point to concede rhetorically and route around; and
  "I'll surface it prominently in the handoff" is not handing the fork back, because by then the user
  is being asked to approve or discard something that already exists.**
  → [[feedback-a-declined-product-question-does-not-go-away]]

- **A USER REQUIREMENT NEVER OUTRANKS RULE 1 (USER RULE, 2026-07-30).** Verbatim: *"If one of my
  requirements blocks a per rule 1 better solution, then drop that requirement."* A stated preference —
  a budget, a scope wish, a "lets not do X" — is an INPUT to the design, not an axiom of it. The moment
  you write *"X would be the right fix, but the user said not to"*, that requirement is a candidate for
  dropping; building the second-best thing around it is the same failure as a suppressive filter.
  **Look FIRST: drop it, build the proper fix, and NAME the dropped requirement in the handoff —
  silently overriding a stated preference is the worse failure. Covers requirements about HOW; does NOT
  cover a product decision about WHAT the user wants.** → [[feedback-drop-my-requirement-if-it-blocks-rule-1]]

- **RUN THE `/qf` LOOP TO CONVERGENCE — do not hand it back every round (USER, 2026-07-30).** Verbatim,
  after a third consecutive hand-back: *"Why are you always stopping running qf, run qf."* The loop's
  terminal state is the critic's **"that holds"**, not "the primary has something to report"; handing
  back makes the user the scheduler for a process with its own stopping condition. Measured on the pass
  that prompted it: rounds 1-11 ran one at a time with a hand-back each; rounds **12-22 ran back to
  back and EVERY ONE landed a material finding**, three of which would have shipped broken — an exclude
  set that was a silent no-op, a deny table that would have made Thai/Tamil/Thaana unwritable, and a
  security bound guarding one of three surfaces. Convergence came at round 22. **Look FIRST: stop only
  on "that holds", on a question only the user can answer, or on a finding that changes the ask —
  never on "the findings are getting narrower" (rounds 17-21 all looked narrow and all landed).**
  `memory/feedback_run_the_qf_loop_to_convergence.md`

- **A protective table defined by a PROPERTY can outlaw the thing it protects.** 2026-07-30: three
  `/qf` rounds refined a name-DENY table defined as `Mn ∪ Me ∪ Mc` (to stop `"A"+U+0301` folding
  differently from `Á`), arguing about its derivation, its font-independence and its migration effect.
  Nobody printed its **contents** until round 15: censused against the shipped faces it is **337
  codepoints — THAI 16, TAMIL 14, THAANA 11, ARABIC 19, HEBREW 8** — and Tamil needs `Mc` vowel signs
  while Thaana is written *entirely* in `Mn`, so the table would have made those scripts **unwritable
  as names in the very commit whose headline advertises them**. A property-defined table reads as
  principled, so review interrogates its derivation and never its membership.
  **VINDICATED AND PARTLY CORRECTED 2026-07-30 (`244b1320`).** The core holds and then some: the marks
  were ADMITTED, and five scripts stopped rendering as base letters with boxes where their marks belong.
  But this row's own remedy clause was wrong, and its numbers were wrong. Measured: **844 is the RAW
  two-part decomposition count** (30 are `Composition_Exclusion`, so 814 compose); "41 marks that ever
  compose / 296 that never" are really **35 / 302**; and **NFC was DROPPED, not built** — its premise
  (`"A"+U+0301` is pixel-indistinguishable from `Á`) is false in our renderer, 1 of ~3,560 face-pair
  combinations, because ImGui does no shaping and there is no GPOS anchor. So "reach for NORMALIZATION
  before prohibition" is the wrong generalisation from a right instinct: the correct move was neither
  denying nor normalising, but **measuring whether the defect exists here at all** — it did not. See
  `memory/lesson_a_standards_equivalence_is_not_your_renderers.md`.
  **Look FIRST: print the members intersected with the domain you
  actually ship; ask what the table forbids a legitimate user from doing; and treat a review that keeps
  refining HOW to build a thing as a signal nobody asked WHETHER it should exist.**

- **A library can SYNTHESISE the very thing your filter governs, on a path the filter does not sit
  on.** 2026-07-30, the first live run of the new superset invariant: our `GlyphExcludeRanges` table
  excludes U+0009 (TAB is `Cc`, hence `no-ink`), four independent checks agreed, and the atlas baked
  it anyway on every peer. `ImFontAtlasBuildSetupFontBakedBlanks` **synthesises** the tab glyph from
  the space glyph's advance and calls `ImFontAtlasBakedAddFontGlyph` with **`src == NULL`**, so it
  never reaches `ImFontAtlasBuildAcceptCodepointForSource` and no exclude list on any config can
  suppress it. The four checks were all correct — they were checks about the TABLE, and the table was
  never consulted. **Look FIRST: a filter is a property of the paths that CONSULT it, so grep the
  dependency for every caller of its add/produce primitive and see which ones route through the
  predicate; when one bypasses, ask what the invariant is FOR rather than which value to exempt — a
  codepoint exemption would have blinded the instrument to the next synthesised glyph, whereas
  "was it RASTERISED" (`PackId != Invalid`) is self-maintaining, and it also distinguishes this from
  the case where the SAME codepoint is a genuine offender (U+0009 is in the FSEX300 and Roboto cmaps,
  and reappeared as a real one under the no-exclude drill).**

- **A text-scanning gate reads prose as code — including the prose that documents the gate.**
  2026-07-30, `tools/text/atlas_regime_gate.ps1`'s first run, two independent failures that CANCELLED
  OUT in the log: it reported `clears=1` on a tree with zero flag clears (the comment explaining the
  deletion quotes the deleted line verbatim, and a regex cannot tell code from documentation — the
  better the deletion is explained, the more likely the gate fails on it), and then printed **PASS**
  anyway, because its escape hatch matched `MEASURED-UPLOAD-VERDICT:` **unanchored** and the design
  doc's own sentence *describing that escape hatch* satisfied it. **An escape specified in prose is
  satisfied by its own specification.** Only the injected `-Drill` control found either. **Look
  FIRST: strip comments before classifying source text (two regexes, and it fixes both directions —
  a clear hidden in `#if 0` was equally invisible); anchor any escape token and require a payload
  (`(?m)^TOKEN:\s*\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}`), so writing the exception is a dated act and not an accident
  of phrasing; and read a drill's GREEN lines as failures.**

- **A sentinel-terminated list cannot contain its sentinel — and zero is a legal codepoint.**
  2026-07-30: a designed, reviewed and ten-rounds-argued `GlyphExcludeRanges` table would have excluded
  **nothing**. The array is zero-terminated (`imgui_draw.cpp:4539-4542` and the sizer at `:3111-3113`
  both walk `while (p[0] != 0)`), and the table began at `no-ink`'s first member, `Cc` = **U+0000** —
  which `fontTools` confirms is in the cmap of FSEX300 and both Robotos. The walk ends at index 0,
  every codepoint is accepted, and the fold-set == render-set invariant breaks for ~1,800 codepoints.
  **Nothing would have complained:** `IM_ASSERT((size & 1) == 0)` passes (0 is even), `IM_ASSERT(size
  <= 64)` passes (0 is small), and `NDEBUG` strips both anyway. Ten rounds interrogated the table's
  membership; none interrogated its encoding. **Look FIRST: when a dependency takes a
  sentinel-terminated list, ask whether the sentinel is a LEGAL MEMBER of the value domain (for
  codepoints, offsets, indices and IDs it usually is); check the FIRST element specifically, because a
  sentinel at index 0 makes the feature vanish rather than half-work; and put the guard in the
  generator you own, since that is the failure nothing downstream can observe.**

- **A bound placed at a render site is a site list — bound the data where it ENTERS.** 2026-07-30: a
  per-frame cap on attacker-driven glyph rasterisation was specified inside the chat FEED draw loop.
  Censused, remote text reaches the rasteriser through at least **three** surfaces — the feed, the
  overhead bubble (`hud.cpp:184`, whose `CalcTextSizeA` **bakes on a miss** before any budget could be
  consulted) and the scoreboard (`scoreboard.cpp:249`) — so the cap guarded one door of three, and the
  two it missed are the ones an attacker would use. Moving it to the receive boundary (`utf8_codec`,
  already the single owner of decoding) bounded every surface **by construction** and **deleted** the
  soft cap, the row-deferral rule and the forward-progress guarantee. The trap: the hazard was
  *discovered* in the chat feed, so the fix was designed there — and **machinery accreting around a
  mechanism is evidence it is at the wrong layer, not evidence it is maturing.** *Look FIRST:* census
  every reader of the attacker-controlled value before bounding its effect; prefer the ingestion
  boundary; and note the follow-on — a boundary-side ledger needs its own thread and lifetime rules
  (ours had to be a game-thread monotone set, not a read of the render thread's `IndexLookup`).

- **A shared cache is priced by the SUM over live configurations, not by one slice.** 2026-07-30: an
  atlas-capacity discharge priced the glyph set at ONE font size and reported a 3x margin. The atlas is
  one texture shared across every live size, and its GC is **pressure-triggered** — `ImFontAtlasBuildDiscardBakes` has
  exactly two call sites, `MakeSpace` (`imgui_draw.cpp:4244`) and `TextureCompact` (`:4306`) — so the
  resident set is everything drawn since the last pressure event. Re-measured as the sum over the sizes
  that can carry remote text: 0.345x + 0.282x + 0.228x = **0.856x of the ceiling, a 17% margin, not
  200%**. The same session had already retired a 12.8 Mpx figure that erred the *other* way by summing
  sizes no single surface can demand. **Look FIRST: ask "resident set = data x WHAT?" and enumerate the
  second axis (sizes, DPI scales, LODs, formats, per-peer variants); find the eviction TRIGGER before
  trusting a bound, because "unused for N frames" can be pressure-only; and report the margin, since
  17% and 200% imply different amounts of instrumentation.**

- **A pass can measure every MECHANISM and never measure the DELIVERABLE.** 2026-07-30: nine `/qf`
  rounds on the ImGui atlas flip measured the init-time sampling instant, the 64-value exclude cap, a
  per-rescale leak, an unbounded fence wait, which face carries U+E0B0, three asserts `NDEBUG` strips —
  and corrected sixteen false claims. **Not one round asked what appears on screen that did not
  before.** The design's own summary said the commit "ships zero new visible glyphs"; round 10 refused
  the premise and two greps settled it — today's fold table is 2,517 codepoints and the em dash, both
  curly-quote pairs, the ellipsis and the ruble sign are **outside** it, while the shipped faces union
  to 9,478 and carry all four (plus Hebrew/Thai/Arabic). The flip turns **+4,741 codepoints from
  fallback box into glyph for zero new DLL bytes** (this row said +5,078 until the build corrected it
  on 2026-07-30: that figure priced an exclude set round 11 later rejected; shipped is 7,258 - 2,517) — the user's actual ask — and was about to be built
  describing itself as delivering nothing. It survived because it was **true of the previous build**
  (s15 deliberately clears the flag) and rode into the section about the commit that deletes that
  clear, and because it was **pessimistic**: every review reflex here is tuned to catch optimism, so an
  understatement passes unchallenged. **Look FIRST: state the deliverable in the user's own units and
  measure it like any other claim; re-derive any sentence copied across a build boundary; give a
  pessimistic status claim the same evidence bar as an optimistic one.**

- **"BUILT, drilled, green" is a statement about the DRILLS, not about the code.** 2026-07-29: chat
  history shipped with two purpose-written drills PASSing 4/4, both shown RED under injection, zero
  probe warnings, a measured frame rate — and a `/qf` phase IMPLEMENTATION pass over the REAL DIFF found
  **twelve defects in four rounds**, one certain to fire in the first 30 seconds of a hands-on. **Not one
  of the twelve would have turned either drill red.** Two earlier `/qf` passes over the design BRIEF (21
  and 17 rounds) found none of them either. A brief is the primary's own prose about its own plan and can
  be argued with forever; code can only be measured — and drills written FROM a design, by its author,
  inherit its blind spots by construction. **Look FIRST: run the implementation pass over the diff before
  a human sees the feature, and never report a drill verdict as the feature's status — state what it
  asserts AND what it therefore cannot see.** An `--inject` control proves ONE BIT (this detector is not
  blind to this one defect), never coverage.
  `memory/lesson_built_and_drilled_is_not_the_same_as_correct.md`
- **A harness WORKAROUND silently deletes the path it works around.** 2026-07-29: `mp.py`'s `_type_chat`
  closes chat with Enter-on-empty, commented "NOT Escape — Escape raises the pause menu and suppresses
  the HUD pass". Correct reasoning; it also removed the user's OWN specified close path ("close like
  minecraft" = ESC) from all coverage, where three stacked defects were later found by hand. The
  instrument was never blind — it was ROUTED, and a routed instrument reports nothing about the road it
  did not take. Worse, the path was avoided *because the product behaves differently there*, which is
  exactly the condition that deserves a test. **Look FIRST: grep your own harness comments for "not X",
  "rather than", "avoid" — each is a coverage debt written in the imperative; print the drill's coverage
  BOUNDARY next to its verdict.** Fifth member of the instrument-blindness family: it can see, and it
  went around. `memory/lesson_a_harness_workaround_removes_a_path_from_coverage.md`
- **ONE capacity expressed in THREE places will disagree.** 2026-07-29, `chat_feed`: `CapRetained` allows
  `kMaxRetained*2` = 200 while a reader is paged back, `Republish` publishes at most `kMaxRetained` = 100
  from the FRONT, and `Snapshot::lines` is sized `kMaxLines+kMaxRetained` = 106 and cannot hold 200 at
  all — so rows 101+ are storable, unpublishable and invisible, and a live row overflowing into that zone
  **disappears off the screen**. Each site is locally right (memory / per-tick copy cost / fixed
  allocation) and two spell the constant identically, so a grep makes them look consistent. **Look FIRST:
  a conditional multiplier on a capacity (`x * (frozen ? 2 : 1)`) is a SECOND capacity wearing the
  first's name — when you raise a ceiling, read every site that bounds the same set by DIRECTION (stores
  / copies / publishes / allocates). And suspending ONE exit from a set does not suspend the others.**
  Capacity-shaped instance of `[[lesson-one-name-for-two-quantities]]`. **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-29,
  the same pass failing its own lesson: the fix's own direction-grep listed `Republish` under "copies"
  and never opened ITS bound (`chat_feed.cpp:328`), so raising `Snapshot::lines` alone would have
  re-created the identical invisible zone — THREE sites move together. And a capacity can disagree
  ACROSS A PEER BOUNDARY, which no single-process grep finds: the record's cap is the PUBLISHER's
  ceiling, the joiner's `CapRetained` is the HOLDER's, and a joiner is NOT paged back — so the
  publisher's ceiling must equal the holder's UNPAGED ceiling or the seed is evicted on arrival.**
  **THIRD INSTANCE + FIXED 2026-07-29 (`293692d7`): building the fix took the count from three sites to
  FIVE. The fifth was `chat_view.cpp`'s hand-sized `kRowCap = 512` — a bound on the SAME quantity
  spelled in a DIFFERENT UNIT (wrapped rows, not lines) in another file at another layer, so no grep
  for `kMaxRetained` could ever reach it; at 206 entries it stopped the build loop after ~128 and
  paging could never reach the oldest history. So the name-grep is necessary and NOT sufficient — also
  walk the data store → publish → layout → draw and check each hop's own bound. Now one BASE
  (`kMaxRetained`) + one NAMED allowance (`kRetentionFreezeFactor`, `chat_feed.h:55`), everything
  derived and `static_assert`ed (`chat_feed.h:64`), and the reader's-window mechanism DELETED rather
  than fixed.**

- **A font-coverage gap can be UNICODE's hole, not the font's.** 2026-07-29: adding Greek to
  `build_repertoire.py`'s `BASE_RANGES` made the `EXPECTED_BASE_GAP` gate FAIL with nine "missing"
  codepoints — `U+0378, 0379, 0380-0383, 038B, 038D, 03A2`. **All nine are permanently UNASSIGNED in
  Unicode**, so no font can carry them and the embedded faces were in fact complete over every assigned
  Greek character; the earlier "Greek 135/144" figure was exactly this arithmetic (144 block slots − 9
  reserved) and reads like a 94% shortfall when it is 100%. A block is written `(0x0370, 0x03FF)` like a
  dense range, so a set-difference against a cmap returns real holes and reserved slots mixed and
  indistinguishable — the same output carried one TRUE hole (`U+A69E`, a Cyrillic letter we really lack)
  formatted identically. The false positives push toward the expensive wrong fix (hunt a fifth donor,
  ship more bytes, narrow the range). **Look FIRST: `unicodedata.name(chr(cp))` raising `ValueError` is
  the one-line assigned/unassigned test — run it before treating a gap as a font deficiency, record the
  unassigned ones in the expectation set WITH the reason, and never ask an atlas for a codepoint nothing
  can draw (it bakes nothing and renders as the fallback box).**
  `memory/lesson_a_coverage_gap_can_be_the_character_sets_own_hole.md`
- **A per-frame filter inside a loop you MEMOIZE may be structural, not cosmetic.** 2026-07-29
  (`293692d7`, defect #10): `chat_view`'s word-wrap loop carried
  `if (drawnAlpha(i) < kAlphaFloor) continue;`. Alpha changes every frame, so keying the memo on it
  defeats the memo — and dropping it looks free, because a fully transparent row draws nothing. But the
  emitted rows feed a fixed array that the ENTIRE paging computation indexes (`bottom`, `shown`,
  `floorBottom`, page size, the pin-anchor search): a filtered row does not merely draw nothing, it does
  not OCCUPY A LINE, so letting it through leaves a visible GAP where a faded message was, everything
  below shifted. Memoisation forces you to enumerate a loop's true inputs and the pressure runs one way
  — toward shrinking the key — so a term gets reclassified as noise exactly when it is load-bearing.
  **Look FIRST: ask what CONSUMES the loop's output, not what the output looks like; if anything
  downstream indexes or counts by emission order, every filter is part of the contract. And when a
  per-frame term blocks a memo, do not delete it — find the condition under which it CANNOT fire
  (here `reveal >= kAlphaFloor` makes filtering impossible, so the memo applies exactly where the cost
  is and the small filtered case just rebuilds).**

- **A requirement about CONTENT is not a requirement about AUTHORITY.** 2026-07-29: the user wrote
  "players should get all history, including chat event feed messages" — a statement about what history
  CONTAINS. The design written from it opened "the lobby record OWNS every history line" and derived a
  host-authorship architecture: the `Keep` enum deleted, two client mirrors deleted, both slot-0
  exclusions moved, two defects dissolved, one new defect found, proto bumped. The next pass's round 1
  asked which of those the ASK needs: **only the proto bump.** Everything else was manufactured by the
  authority reading — which was also WRONG, on an impossibility. The trap is that the authority reading
  is the more engineering-shaped one (it names an owner, an invariant, a seam) and it GENERATES WORK,
  which feels like progress. **Look FIRST: name the axis a user statement constrains — WHAT (content) /
  WHO (authority) / WHEN (ordering) / HOW MUCH (capacity) — and write it down before designing. The
  tell for this error: a one-sentence clarification that produces deletions and an authority migration;
  a clarification normally SHRINKS the design.**
  `memory/lesson_a_reframe_about_content_read_as_a_claim_about_authority.md`
- **~~An event that narrates a LINK's death cannot be authored across that link.~~ FALSIFIED BY
  MEASUREMENT 2026-07-29 — the surviving lesson is the OPPOSITE one.** The original claim: the host
  cannot author `"X left the game"` on a TIMEOUT, "over the link whose failure the sentence describes".
  A whole architecture (RECORD-ONLY) was built on it. Then the user said *"just follow what minecraft or
  mta does"*, and the vendored source settles it: **`CGame.cpp:1581-1586` broadcasts `CPlayerQuitPacket`
  to all joined peers EXCEPT the parting one, INCLUDING on `QUIT_TIMEOUT`** — and the client composes
  the sentence locally from a reason enum (`CClientGame.cpp:3393-3415`). The sentence never needed the
  DEAD link; it rides everyone ELSE's live links, and only the host can see the timeout at all. The
  error was conflating **"the departing peer cannot be told"** (true, and nobody needs it) with
  **"the host cannot author it"** (false, and MTA has shipped the opposite for 15+ years). The residue
  of the original claim governs exactly one line — `"the host left"` — which is a PRIVATE local notice
  and was never part of the lobby's record. **Look FIRST: an impossibility argument about a message and
  a link must name WHICH RECIPIENTS the link serves. "Cannot be delivered to X" is not "cannot be
  authored"; check the other N-1 recipients before deriving an architecture from it — and check the
  prior art before deriving one at all.**

- **A required PARAMETER can be the ANSWER to the question you are about to re-ask.** 2026-07-29: six
  `/qf` rounds went into a private-constructor type to replace `chat_feed`'s `Keep` parameter, on the
  (normally correct) smell that a per-site classification argument is a habit rather than an invariant.
  `chat_feed.h:13-18` had already recorded the experiment that settles it: a data predicate WAS tried
  and **"got 12 of 15 wrong, failing on exactly the lines that matter"**. The parameter is a measured
  conclusion, and a private ctor whose friend list is the admitted sites is that parameter in a type's
  clothes. The primary had even QUOTED that line earlier in the same pass, for a different purpose.
  **Look FIRST: grep a parameter's declaration for a comment explaining WHY it is a parameter before
  replacing it. Then ask which of three properties is actually missing — mandatory / visible /
  CENSUSABLE. A required parameter already gives the first two; most "make it a type" designs are
  really after the third, which a gate delivers without touching the type.**
  `memory/lesson_a_parameter_may_exist_because_a_predicate_was_already_tried.md`
- **A seed-only record can give a JOINER more history than someone who was present.** 2026-07-29: the
  chat record admitted `"<nick> was turned away: <reason>"`, which is HOST-ONLY
  (`player_handshake_version.cpp:116` gates on `role()==Host`; the refused client gets a popup). Present
  clients never see it — but a peer joining an hour later would receive it in the seed, making the
  newcomer's history a strict SUPERSET of the history of someone who was there the whole time. The
  census asked "is this a shared-world fact the host observes?", which turned-away passes; it never
  asked **who else already knows**, which is a property of DELIVERY, not of the fact. Invisible from
  either side alone — only holding a present client's view next to a joiner's exposes it, and no drill
  compares two peers' histories to each other. **Look FIRST: for any join-delivered record, census the
  DELIVERY per row — which peers learn of this LIVE? A `role() == Host` guard on a push site is the
  tell. Admissibility rule: a surface belongs in a seeded record only if every present peer already
  learns of it live.** `memory/lesson_a_seed_only_record_gives_the_joiner_more_than_the_present.md`
- **An instrument's assertion WINDOW must not be movable by the thing it measures.** 2026-07-29
  building chat history: the drill's window was bounded by a log marker emitted at the END of the draw
  function, BELOW an early return taken when there was nothing to draw. On the INJECTED run (history
  emptied) the marker did not fire until the next message arrived — so that message landed OUTSIDE the
  window it was supposed to be inside and an unrelated assertion went red for the wrong reason. The
  clean run could never expose it: with content present, marker and surface state agree exactly. **Look
  FIRST: ask literally "can the bug I am testing for delete this marker?" — put window markers on the
  LIFECYCLE state, above every content-dependent return; and read the injected run's failures one by
  one, naming which the injection should legitimately break.** This is the fourth instrument-blindness
  family: it can SEE the phenomenon and still frame it out.
  `memory/lesson_an_instruments_window_must_not_move_with_what_it_measures.md`
- **A state change a later clamp undoes has still fired its SIDE EFFECTS.** 2026-07-29: PgUp set the
  chat scroll to PINNED inside the key handler; a clamp two statements later moved the view back and
  un-pinned it. Net state: unchanged, correctly. But the setter LOGS an edge and freezes the store's
  retention, so a view that never moved announced a successful page-back and the drill believed it.
  Set-then-correct is idiomatic and harmless for a plain variable, and unsafe the instant the setter is
  a function. **Look FIRST: before writing `X = v` early and correcting below, OPEN the setter — if it
  is not an assignment, compute an intent and commit ONCE after every clamp. If you are testing the
  same condition on both sides of a clamp, the order is wrong.**
  `memory/lesson_a_speculative_state_change_still_fires_its_side_effects.md`

- **Converging a QUALITATIVE STATUS TAXONOMY: the test is "new VALUE vs new AXIS", never "a control
  that changes nothing" — and a converged FORM is not verified DATA.** Building the per-system sync
  profiles (2026-07-23, 11 `/qf` rounds), every control moved the status model (verdict×evidence /
  two-field remainder / sync-lane trichotomy / authority), and "keep profiling until one changes
  nothing" was declared as the convergence bar — WRONG: a qualitative vocabulary meets new facet shapes
  forever, so a change-nothing control is unachievable and the bar is unfalsifiable. The right bar:
  does a new instance add a new VALUE to an existing axis (normal, expected) or a whole new AXIS (the
  model was incomplete)? Each axis must be EARNED by a falsification instance — two rows that collapse
  (become indistinguishable) without it — and the vocabulary is complete only when every KNOWN measured-
  red maps in with no leftover; completeness is asserted, never proven, so it ships OPEN with the
  falsification test as the standing gate. SEPARATELY: surviving N critique rounds proves the FORM is
  coherent, NOT that the DATA is right — two cell VALUES were wrong (authority mislabeled) and both were
  caught by READING THE CODE, not by the form holding; the doc must SAY so or the next reader takes
  convergence for verification. Confirmed at scale 2026-07-23: a full ~67-system / ~200-facet sweep
  added a THIRD value (`peer-owned`) and still ZERO new axes, and the honest ceiling is WIRE-complete
  (provable: 113 kinds + 13 streams all accounted) but FACET-complete NEVER. *Look FIRST:*
  `docs/COOP_SYNC_PROFILES.md` §3+§8 (the axis set + the convergence call) and
  `[[lesson-converge-a-taxonomy-by-new-axis-not-a-null-control]]`.
  `memory/lesson_converge_a_taxonomy_by_new_axis_not_a_null_control.md`
- **A WIRE-LANE / enum census is BLIND to no-wire systems; completeness is WIRE-provable but
  FACET-never.** Filling the sync profiles to the whole tree (2026-07-23), a sweep keyed on wire lanes
  produced ~58 systems and MISSED six — three of which carry NO ReliableKind at all (moderation =
  GNS-close + host files; save-suppression = client-local hooks; spawn-authority = client-local park):
  "coordination by construction" the host wins by being the only peer not running the local suppressor,
  invisible to any lane census. Only a system-by-system source read finds them. The honest completeness
  ceiling splits in two: WIRE-complete IS provable (enumerate all 113 ReliableKinds → each has a router
  case → each maps to a system; all 13 unreliable MsgType streams cross-checked to a facet — no lane
  outside the catalog), FACET-complete is NEVER (a race is not a lane; a HUD/sound/guard has nothing to
  census). Also: the self-audit's `ReliableKind::\b` grep agreed with itself (word-boundary matched
  nothing → ~66 false MISSING); the reliable signal was the file-stem cross-check, hand-triaged.
  *Look FIRST:* `docs/COOP_SYNC_PROFILES.md` §9 (residual + dig) and

- **A CAUSING probe must prove its stimulus LANDED before its verdict means anything** (sharpens
  "a probe must COUNT, not confirm"). When the probe has to trigger the event it measures, an absent
  result line is ambiguous: dead lane, or dead trigger? Measured 2026-07-22: the R11b instrument fired
  `addLoot` on the first two world containers by registry order, both EMPTY, changed nothing — and only
  avoided reporting a false RED because it also measured its own effect and said
  `records 0 -> 0 ... the TRIGGER is inert, so an absent 'callback ENTERED' line says nothing about the
  lane`. Pick the target by the property that makes the stimulus VALID (a container with contents), not
  by convenience. Once fixed, the same instrument caught two real bugs in the lane it was testing.
  **Sharpened 2026-07-22: a positive control must name the SAME CHANNEL the test reads.** A runbook's
  host-side control grepped `PROP-DROP|SPAWN broadcast`; both are the wrong channel for the host
  (`PROP-DROP` is client-only, `SPAWN broadcast` is the `takeObj` POST observer that has never fired),
  so it returned 0 on a healthy run and the take read as VOID when it had passed — the host's real line
  is `host_spawn_watcher: spawn-seam adopted`. A mis-named control is WORSE than none: it manufactures
  a false negative and discards a real measurement. *Look FIRST:* grep the source for the exact log
  string, and confirm its emitter runs in the ROLE the step is performed as.
  **A SHAPE is not a COUNT of the disputed thing (2026-07-24)** — a readout was extended to print each
  inventory record's payload SHAPE (elements per value group) to test "a taken item lands empty". It
  FALSIFIED that (the taken record printed `{b5,f3,nm2}`) and still could not settle the weaker
  question, because the shapes differ BY CLASS (crowbar `{b5,f1,nm2}` / food `{b6,f4,i1,nm2}` / drive
  `+sig1`): the group slots are a **class fingerprint** present regardless of the VALUES in them, so a
  spawn-default record and a restored one of the same class print IDENTICALLY. *The general tell:* if
  the output would look the SAME under both hypotheses, it is a confirmation instrument, not a
  measurement — even when it just falsified something. Ask which VALUE differs between the two worlds
  (here: a `sig1` a fresh spawn cannot have) and whether your output contains it.

- **A cross-source SUM instrument needs a positive control PER SOURCE, not one direction.** When a
  verifier's verdict is a SUM across multiple stores/peers, the positive control must be run so EACH
  source is, in at least one run, the known-positive that holds the target — else the un-exercised
  source's read is unproven and a real defect there reads as ABSENT. Measured 2026-07-23: the
  container-race no-dup verifier passed a `taker=host` control (`host 1 + client 0 = 1`), which proved
  the client sees the CONTAINER but NOT that the client's OWN personal-store walk finds X — exactly where
  a losing client's optimistic dup lives; a blind client-personal walk would make a real race dup read
  `sum==1` = false "no dup". Fix: the MIRROR control (`taker=client`, host idle) → `0 + 1 = 1` with the
  client copy at its own `idx=0`. A sum hides which source contributed (`1+0` vs `0+1` are the same
  total), so print WHERE each match was found (per-source slice id). *Look FIRST:* enumerate the sources
  of any aggregate-count instrument; run the control once per source; keep the matches decomposable.

- **String presence in a cooked asset is NOT a structural fact** — a grep hit inside a `.uasset`/`.uexp`
  proves only that the string is in the package NameMap (UE bakes a shared string pool: a parent's member
  names and imported type names land in any asset that references them). Measured 2026-07-22:
  `grep -la propInventory_GEN_VARIABLE objects/*.uasset` → **168** classes incl. `candle`, `rug`, `poster`,
  `wisp_*`; the structural check (an **export** whose `ClassIndex` resolves to `propInventory`) → ~10, all
  real containers. The bad instrument manufactured a killer counterexample (`prop_toolbox`) that nearly
  forced a whole SCS-walk/CDO-probe predicate for an invariant that was correct all along — **it invented
  work**. Third instance of one family in a single session ("census" label; "append-order" from one
  `Array_Add` without reading the guard; this). *Look FIRST:* parse with `kismet-analyzer to-json` and read
  `Exports[].ClassIndex` / `.SuperIndex` / `LoadedProperties` through the `Imports` table; use `grep` to
  LOCATE candidates, never to CONCLUDE. `memory/lesson_string_presence_in_cooked_asset_is_not_a_structural_fact.md`
- **SAVE-EXCLUDED is not RUNTIME-ABSENT, and our logs cannot prove absence.** `prop_dronesack_C::
  ignoreSave -> EX_True` was read as "does not exist at runtime"; it means the SAVE SYSTEM skips it.
  `Aprop_dronesack_C : Aprop_C` is a real actor with its own `container@0x0380`. The corroborating
  `grep -ci sack <log>` = 1 was equally worthless: an actor with no save Key is never enrolled as an
  Element, so it can never print — **the log was silent about a thing it is structurally incapable of
  reporting.** The false conclusion then RETRACTED a whole line of investigation for a session and a
  half. Same family as the string-presence row with the sign flipped: there PRESENCE was read as
  structure, here ABSENCE was read as non-existence; both are "the instrument does not measure what I
  claimed". *Look FIRST:* ask what would have to be true for our logs to mention it (enrolment? save
  key? class filter?) — if any of those excludes it, enumerate live objects
  (`FindObjectsByClass`), do not grep. Read `ignoreSave`/`Transient`/`bNetLoadOnClient` as a
  SUBSYSTEM's treatment, never as existence. `memory/lesson_save_excluded_is_not_runtime_absent.md`
- **Run `/qf` (up to 15 rounds) BEFORE any non-trivial implementation + when planning new changes** —
  default to it; the adversarial pass is where crutches/wrong-layer/un-measured-assumption get caught
  before cementing. `memory/feedback_qf_before_implementation.md`
- **The /qf critic has a SELECTIVE-TRUST blind spot** — it interrogates claims individually + accepts the
  primary's answers as settled, so "trust a source for X, distrust it for Y" slips a whole pass. Skill
  patched 2026-07-13 (source-consistency / cross-answer / undone-measurement angles); still check manually.
  `memory/feedback_qf_selective_trust_blindspot.md`
- **The /qf critic escalates WITHIN THE FRAME it is handed** — so a MIGRATION design (repoint/rebind/re-key)
  that migrates the ONE identity map the brief names, while a PARALLEL map keyed on the same entity finalizes
  late, slips a whole multi-round pass (11 rounds + a "that holds" missed the host-only KerfurId table). When
  a design migrates identity, ENUMERATE every map that keys on the entity + prove the op updates or gates ALL
  of them. Skill patched 2026-07-13 nite (IDENTITY-MAP-COMPLETENESS angle + brief-enumeration + convergence
  bar). `memory/feedback_qf_enumerate_identity_maps_on_migration.md`
- **The /qf critic inherits the primary's BRIEF as ground truth (blind-spot #3: CARRIED-FRAMING)** — the
  fresh-per-round critic sees only what the primary wrote, and the primary writes its own brief, so a
  load-bearing NOUN it introduced as an inference and hardened by repetition ("the existing two-phase arm
  record" — actually FOUR distinct converge mechanisms) launders into an apparent fact every fresh critic
  reads blind. Worst in `/qf N` auto-loop (N self-summarized briefs, no external check). Fix: tag facts by
  PROVENANCE (measured-artifact vs carried-framing) + code-verify the 1-2 nouns the design hangs on before
  convergence + SURFACE to the user after any material REFRAME instead of auto-continuing (the user, holding
  the real history + raw artifacts, is the only party who catches framing drift, retroactive-foundation-
  invalidation, and cross-artifact synthesis). Skill patched 2026-07-14 (FRAMING-PROVENANCE angle + brief
  provenance-tag + reframe-surface + carried-primitive convergence bar).

- **A NEGATIVE grep is only evidence if the pattern can match a KNOWN-POSITIVE line** — before concluding
  "0 matches -> never happens / mechanism dead / gate clean", prove the pattern CAN match the positive case
  (grep one real hit; check the log line even CONTAINS the field you filter on). A query structurally blind
  to its target returns 0 and the null reads as PROOF. Worst kind: not a case that never arose, but one that
  arose EVERY time and was invisible to the query. Cost 2026-07-14: `grep 'grab_hook\[destroy-seam\].*kerfur'`
  =0 "proved" the destroy-seam never fires for kerfur (the line prints actor/key/eid, NO class) -> declared
  `TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy` dead -> nearly RULE-2-deleted the guard sitting on bug1's actual relay.
  Corollary: when ONE negative-grep turns out blind, RE-RUN the audit on every other "0 fires" in the
  inventory. 2nd instance 2026-07-16: asserted "the master server isn't in the repo" from a `find -type d
  -iname '*master*'` — blind, because it's a FILE `tools/coop_master_server.py` (679 LOC stdlib) a dir
  search can't match. Search by the artifact's real shape (`glob **/*.py`, a signature string like
  `/v1/host`), not a guessed folder. **3rd + 4th instances 2026-07-24, both in ONE session and both the
  "convenient" way:** (a) wrong LEVEL — `loadObjects` showed 0 name-refs to `inventoryData`, read as "the
  load path doesn't touch it"; resolving CALLS shows `EX_LocalVirtualFunction loadData` x3 (it dispatches,
  like `loadTriggers`), and calls live as `StackNode` INDICES not names; (b) wrong SCOPE — grepped
  `save_block.cpp`, found no `saveObjects`, asserted "an undocumented second consequence" into a MEASURED
  doc; the contract is in `save_block.h` Part 3, which names `saveObjects` explicitly under a user mandate
  3 weeks older. **The tell both share: a zero was accepted because it made the story better.** A negative
  that FLATTERS the hypothesis needs the known-positive check MORE, not less. Also: `save_block: BLOCKED`
  = 0 across every log EVER (no known-positive anywhere — the detour has never fired), so its silence
  proved nothing. **5th instance 2026-07-24, in the very turn that wrote the near-twin lesson: wrong
  CASE.** Searched `"Player"` (the SDK header's spelling, `propInventory.hpp: bool Player`) for who sets
  the personal-inventory flag, got 0 everywhere, and wrote into a MEASURED doc that the setter was "not
  visible in any bytecode — native or a defaults blob, not our toolchain". The serialized BP property is
  **`player`**, lowercase, sitting in that same asset's component template
  (`propInventory_GEN_VARIABLE`: `index=0 player=True customVolume=50000`) — which answered the question
  outright and explained why the container's `loadData` override is an empty stub (the slot is baked at
  construction). Two spellings of ONE field. *The free tell:* 0 in EVERY package, including ones that
  must use it, is a blindness signal, not a finding — grep both the reflected and serialized spellings,
  or case-insensitively. **6th + 7th instances 2026-07-24 (the ini `/qf`):** (6) to prove a config token
  had "never been documented" I grepped `docs/` + `README.md` — and missed `release/votv-coop.ini`, a
  user-facing example ini in the repo that documents the token AND seeds the exact layout under design;
  the search space for "never documented" is *every artifact a user could receive*. (7) NEW SUB-SPECIES —
  **the CORPUS was blind, not the pattern**: a differential old-vs-new run over the 4 real inis reported
  ZERO verdict flips, but those files have no duplicate keys, no `yes|on|true` flag values, and the key
  filter excluded the one live phantom key, so the sample could not exhibit ANY change class. A clean
  corpus measures the corpus. Fixture with INJECTED positives, shared by every instrument, and a run that
  reports zero must first prove it can report non-zero.
  `memory/lesson_negative_grep_verify_against_known_positive.md`
- **A near-twin name (`X` vs `X2`) lets a DEAD function impersonate the live one — the discriminator is the
  CALLER COUNT, not the body** (2026-07-24). `mainGamemode::putObjectInventory` writes
  `saveSlot.inventoryData` x6, calls `getData`/`noRespawn`/`K2_DestroyActor`, plays `inventory_Cue` — it
  reads end-to-end like THE pickup path, and it has **zero callers game-wide**. All 24 apparent references
  are substring hits on `mainPlayer::putObjectInventory2`, a different function on a different class writing
  the OTHER store (`GObjStack`). Both grep polarities fail in opposite directions and neither is flagged: a
  substring grep says "24 callers" (all false); an exact grep says "0 calls here" — literally TRUE and
  substantively misleading, because the behaviour IS present via the `2` variant. Cost: `inventoryData`
  looked like it had a live pickup writer, when its only live writer is `saveObjects`' projection copy and
  gameplay never reads it back. **It had already bitten twice:** `COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md` glossed
  `putObjectInventory` as "=R-pickup", and `votv-inventory-drop-spawn-RE-2026-05-24.md` listed it as a live
  helper with no note that nothing calls it — the stale row is the likely reason the 2026-07-24 pass started
  out treating it as live. Both corrected. *Look FIRST:* before building on "X does Y", grep **who calls X**
  with the BARE name and again as a substring, and compare the counts — a difference means a near-twin
  exists. In UE4 BPs a `2`/`_new`/`_old` suffix is the usual shape of a refactor that left the original
  compiled in. **And give the count its own known-positive** — "zero callers" is itself a negative grep:
  here the bare-name query still returned `mainGamemode` (the definition) and the substring query
  returned 24, proving the method reaches the corpus. Strip those and "0 callers" is indistinguishable
  from a blind pattern. `memory/lesson_near_twin_function_name_hides_a_dead_original.md`
- **A failure branch that shares a resolver with the success path is UNREACHABLE — and that dissolves the
  ambiguity without a run** (2026-07-24). `dup_verifier`'s `player=0` looked like it fused "read failed"
  with "found nothing", and two rounds were spent hedging + designing a control to force the failure.
  Structural answer, in the same file: `CountItemInstances` returns -1 at its own `!save` guard BEFORE any
  COUNT prints, and `INV::ReadAll` has exactly TWO returns (censused) — the SAME `ResolveSaveSlot()`, and
  `return true` (its offsets are compile-time constants, no post-resolve failure path), both in ONE GT
  task. So every historical `player=0` beside a scan summary already meant "read OK, found zero". *Look
  FIRST:* when a line looks fused, census the reader's return paths and check whether caller and reader
  gate on the SAME guard — reachability is a read, not a run. And when a control fails, read WHICH guard
  it hit: a control tripping a different guard than the one under test is a finding about guard ORDER.
  `memory/lesson_fused_failure_branch_sharing_a_resolver_is_unreachable.md`
- **A SYNTACTIC marker set over the class dump CANNOT express a SEMANTIC property** ("is this coop-relevant
  / can it diverge between peers"), and the reason is an ERROR ASYMMETRY, not a tuning problem: the
  false-NEGATIVE side is measurable, the false-POSITIVE side is uncalibratable in principle (there is no
  ground truth for "should have been counted"), so over-inclusion can never be bounded. Measured 2026-07-22
  while trying to GENERATE a coop-readiness % with the denominator taken from the game: a filter
  (`ReceiveTick` | `getData`+`loadData` | interaction verbs) over 2291 BP classes yielded 686 and threw 16
  of 45 already-synced classes (**36%**) into "inert content" — including `UsaveSlot_C` (32 own fns), where
  `GObjStack` lives. The set is Actor-shaped + player-interaction-shaped, structurally blind to non-Actor
  carriers (`USaveGame`/`UActorComponent`/`UUserWidget`) and to spawner/ticker/event behaviour. Two
  instrument defects on the way, both plausible-looking: ancestor-walking to engine roots returned "100%
  covered" (every class reaches `AActor`), and exact-name grep scored `Anpc_krampus_C` + all 11 `Awisp_*_C`
  as never-touched while our code matches them by SUBSTRING at runtime. **The dump ENUMERATES (2291 classes;
  838 with zero own functions are a structural floor that cannot diverge by construction) — it does not
  CLASSIFY.** Corollary that decided the status column, measured the same day: of 44 doc-named classes only
  **3** are hands-on VERIFIED, 11 AS-BUILT, 30 carry no status token at all — a boolean "coop-correct"
  column filled from doc claims would have scored ~44 green, a **22x** overstatement (originally recorded as 14x on a count of 3; `Aeyer_C` was a CONDITION, not a verdict -- corrected 2026-07-22 night) on the only rung that
  means "works for the player". Hence a LADDER (structural floor / AS-BUILT grepped / VERIFIED hands-on),
  each rung measured by its own source, reported as a profile not one number — and the AS-BUILT rung must
  never read as "works" (Q-STACK was green as a lane yet sequential-only, `CONFLICT=0`; R11 counted as
  synced until the census killed it). Look FIRST:
  `research/findings/architecture-audits/votv-coop-readiness-metric-DESIGN-2026-07-22.md` §3.
  `memory/lesson_syntactic_marker_set_cannot_express_semantic_relevance.md`
- **A class MEMBER declaration is indistinguishable from a class HEADER by a bare regex** — in the CXX
  dump `class Aprop_fireExt_C* fireExt;` matches `class X_C` exactly as a header does, so splitting on
  the bare form cuts each body at its own member declarations and credits the functions that follow to
  the member's TYPE. Measured 2026-07-22: `AfireExtHolder_C` reported 0 own functions while its four
  went to `Aprop_fireExt_C`, putting the zero-behaviour floor at 1170 where it is 838 — a 332-class
  error sitting under every ratio, and entirely self-consistent from inside the instrument. Caught only
  by READING four bodies the rule called empty. Require the inheritance colon or the opening brace.
  Corollary: "which of these two rules is right" was the wrong question — there was one rule and one
  broken one; ask whether each counts what it claims before comparing outputs. Look FIRST: the
  `CLASS_RE` comment in `tools/coverage.py`.
  `memory/lesson_class_member_declaration_looks_like_a_class_header.md`
- **Anchor a coverage/status claim to a REGISTRATION, not to a MENTION** — a registration (an entry in a
  dispatch/handler table) either reaches a callback or it does not; a mention (a name in a string
  literal, a grep hit) can serve a UI list or an enumeration. Measured 2026-07-22: the class-level
  literal anchor is false-positive on enumeration literals, and a file-path heuristic to separate them
  answered BACKWARDS on known positives (narrowed out the real lanes `ApiramidSpawner_C` /
  `Aticker_base_C`, kept `AATV_C` / `Abed_C`). The verb-level anchor (registration in `vm_dispatch`) has
  no such failure mode — so the FINER granularity carries the STRONGER anchor, inverting the usual
  expectation: granularity and anchor strength are independent axes. State the new anchor's own limit
  before building on it (registration cannot see PE-seam or field-poll lanes; size unmeasured).
  `memory/lesson_a_registration_is_a_functional_fact_a_mention_is_not.md`
- **A unit of measure must be able to EXPRESS the case you already know is red** — before adopting a
  unit for any coverage/readiness metric, take a failure you have already SEEN and ask what row it
  occupies. If it has none, the metric reports GREEN over it with the authority of a generated number.
  Measured 2026-07-22: the unit changed three times in one session and the same test killed each —
  class hid that the container's simultaneous grab is unexercised; VERB would have scored
  `addObject`/`takeObj` VERIFIED and shown the container green, because the red facet is a race on the
  slot FIELD and has no verb shape at all. The trap is that each new unit looked strictly better
  (finer + a stronger anchor), and "can it represent the known failure" is not a question about
  precision, so it never gets asked. Corollary: a unit is a claim about the MECHANISM, not just
  granularity — "verb" asserts behaviour is intercepted, but much of our sync mirrors FIELDS (pose,
  DeskInput, weather) and is invisible to a verb denominator on both sides. Look FIRST: run the
  known-red test BEFORE fixing the denominator, which is where a unit gets locked in.

- **Before changing a FUNCTION's behavior, enumerate ALL its call sites + state what each expects; before
  SUBTRACTING an output at a seam, enumerate every other producer/consumer at that seam** — acting on an
  incomplete map of what you're touching is ONE recurring root with many faces (a "mechanism" that is N
  mechanisms; a converge fn with an unenumerated 3rd/4th caller; a "suppressor" that is 3 coordinating
  broadcasters; a proxy criterion that only correlates with the real fact). A subtraction breaks unenumerated
  consumers SILENTLY (no error). Prefer the DIRECT fact over a PROXY. Cost 2026-07-14: captured-B wired into
  `ConvergeAfterConversion` without mapping its 4 callers (the POLL death-watch was the one that duped); fixed
  by enumerating the seam's 3 PropSpawn broadcasters FIRST -> "track-but-don't-broadcast" (remove the output,
  keep the tracked-flag contract the others coordinate on). `memory/feedback_enumerate_call_sites_before_changing_behavior.md`
- **A RULE-2 retire census = the NAME vocabulary + the ALIAS/DATAFLOW vocabulary** — s27's
  netloopback name-grep was blind to the `displayOffsetX` chain (net_pump::Tick param →
  puppet_drive shift, "loopback mirror") that only the dying scenario ever fed nonzero; and the
  first closing negative grep matched nothing INCLUDING its own known-positive because the pattern
  was narrower than the vocabulary. Walk the retired code's outgoing call expressions per-argument
  ("who else passes non-default here?") + grep prose synonyms, then gate on a control that must hit.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-26 (native browser):** a `server_browser::` grep found "nine call sites
  in four files" and was sold as the set. It missed the ALIAS half entirely -- `VOTVCOOP_BROWSER_OPEN`
  opens the surface from `imgui_overlay.cpp:721-724`, and **`tools/cursor_probe.py:39,42` +
  `tools/master_fetch_probe.py:78,89` drive that env var and BLOCK on the literal log line
  `"server browser starts visible"`**. So the retire commit would have deleted the trigger of the
  only instrument that measures the cursor, in the same diff that re-roots cursor behaviour. **A
  retire census must grep the ENV VARS and the LOG STRINGS, and must include `tools/`** -- a Python
  runner coupled to a C++ log line is invisible to every C++ grep.
  **THIRD INSTANCE 2026-08-26 (the proxy retirement) -- wrong PREDICATE, not wrong PLACE.** I ran
  `grep -rn "multivoid-" tools/release/` and called the release lane covered. `[V]` It was not:
  `publish.ps1:25,27` hard-throws `"expected xinput1_3.dll"`, `ledger_lib.ps1:231` bakes
  "+ `xinput1_3.dll` (the loader)" into EVERY release body. **I opened the right files and asked the
  wrong question** -- I censused for the thing that SURVIVES (the payload) instead of the thing that
  DIES. A second round found a third tier: `ledger_lib.ps1:149` pins the install PATH
  `WindowsNoEditor\VotV\Binaries\Win64`, which no `xinput1_3` grep can reach either, because a
  retirement changes where the mod LIVES and not only what it is called. **So the vocabulary has
  three tiers -- its NAME, the things that die WITH it (env vars `MULTIVOID_DUP_FILES`/`MULTIVOID_LOADED`),
  and the FACTS ABOUT THE WORLD that were true only because it existed** (an install path, a "you need
  both files" sentence, a fixture map, an artifact's expected count). Write down what the world looks
  like AFTER, then grep for every sentence that becomes false -- the retired symbol is the one thing
  you will not forget.
  `memory/lesson_retire_census_alias_vocabulary.md`
- **A reading taken AT an edge is not a measurement OF the interval** — `everSeen=0` sampled at a
  capture transition became "the game issues ZERO SetCursorPos calls in 18 s of gameplay", written
  into a shipping header; `cursor_probe.py`'s own counter refuted it minutes later (~120/s). The
  reading was right at that instant and false about the window, because the signal warms up AFTER
  the edge. Before asserting an absence, grep for a counter that already counts the thing.

- **Lengthening an instrument outgrows the harness that runs it** — a probe hold 2.2 s -> 5.2 s
  silently exceeded `mp.py --duration 45` (counted from LAUNCH; boot alone is ~50 s). The game was
  killed mid-rung and the runner reported it as FOUR failures, one of which accused the probe of
  stranding the switcher. A cluster of "no X line" FAILs is a TRUNCATION signature — check whether

  STRONGER red flag, not weaker.** Born 2026-07-15: four consecutive fabricated nouns
  (`serverStorageComp`/`ELEMENT`/`getAll`/`getServerStorage`, all 0 hits) + a "ship it" for a build
  `git status` showed never existed — caught every time by grep+git, never by reasoning.
  **SHARPENED 2026-07-22: verifying the CITED FACT is not verifying the CONCLUSION.** An agent's
  facts were all TRUE by grep ("`droneContainer` occurs in one asset", "`getObjectFromKey` is an
  exact `Array_Find`") but its LEAP ("therefore the drone spawns its own container") was never
  tested; it became the central result of a 733-line RE doc and a counting probe killed it on the
  first sample. Two levels: are the facts real (grep), AND does the conclusion follow / what would
  falsify it? "X can never happen, therefore Y" is a RUNTIME prediction — tag `[RD]`, settle with a
  count before building. **2026-08-25 adds a third level: the SEVERITY is a claim too, and it is the
  one you are most likely to accept.** An audit filed a CRITICAL whose arithmetic was exactly right
  and re-derived independently — and whose severity was wrong: the constant it attacked TIGHTENS the
  bound rather than loosening it, so the behaviour described was inside what the module already
  declares. Accepting the label would have added an invented constant to a MEASURE-ONLY build whose
  stated purpose is to measure the number that constant needs (`[[feedback-probe-dont-guess-rule]]`).
  What was real in the finding was something else entirely, one level over — and finding THAT is what
  produced the fix. Two sentences of arithmetic settled it ("what does the bound alone permit over the
  same interval?"). A correct calculation attached to the wrong verdict is more persuasive than either
  half alone, because the calculation checks out and the verdict rides in behind it.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/feedback_verify_handed_down_measurement_before_building.md`
- **A probe must COUNT, not CONFIRM — and must never resolve through the mechanism under suspicion.**
  A probe written to confirm "the drone spawns its own container" would have looked the container up
  BY KEY — the very operation suspected of being broken — and agreed. Written instead to enumerate
  `FindObjectsByClass` and print every row, it answered `containers=1` (the saved one, and it IS
  `drone.container`) on sample #1 and killed the conclusion. Second instance in the same probe: a
  recorded "mystery" (contents 2->0 in 8 s, a sack transfer theorised) dissolved once EVERY
  `GObjStack` slot was read instead of one — `[1] 2->1` paired with `[0] 3->4` is just a player
  taking an item. Watching one row invents mysteries the neighbouring rows explain.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/feedback_probe_must_count_not_confirm.md`
- **Cite SECTIONS, not line ranges, in a file you are also editing.** Writing a new design doc I cited
  `ROADMAP.md:62-66` and `COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md:324-326`, then edited both files later the same session
  to add supersession notes — the first citation became **circular** (it now pointed at my own
  supersession note instead of the claim being superseded) and the second landed on a bare `## 10.`
  header. Line numbers are for source you are NOT touching; a superseded doc gets a section anchor plus
  a quoted fragment. Re-read every line citation you wrote at the end of a doc sweep — your own edits
  are the likeliest thing to have broken them. Second instance in two days (the prior sweep found two
  lessons pointing at lines a fix had moved). **Same failure at tree scale:** renumbering the project
  phase arc shifted **24 "Phase 7+" forward-references across 6 docs** by one — and the tree carries
  TWO unrelated phase numberings (the project arc 1-8 vs `COOP_METHODOLOGY`'s work phases 0-5, which
  are also the `## Phase N` headings inside ROADMAP). A number is a citation into an ordered list, and
  ordered lists renumber: **name the target** ("the public-server phase") and it cannot rot.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson_cite_sections_not_lines_in_files_you_also_edit.md`
- **A source cannot confirm a belief it planted.** A `/qf` round caught me tagging a conclusion
  `inferred` while `ROADMAP.md` phase 6 already fixed that same conclusion as an "architectural
  commitment decided up front" — I had inherited the framing and then cited it back as independent
  corroboration. Also check the cited entry for FUSION: that one answered *who arbitrates* and *who
  simulates* at once, and only one half was still true. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/feedback_qf_selective_trust_blindspot.md` (2026-07-20 section)
- **Your own tool can manufacture a false outage.** Python reported `certificate has expired` against
  the production master; the SERVER cert had 86 days left and `curl` verified the chain fine — the stale
  CA bundle was local. A ready-made causal story (snapshot cert + a documented renewal hazard) made the
  error read as confirmation rather than data. **Reproduce with a second, independently-trusted client
  before escalating**; for TLS read the served cert's own dates, which are a fact about the server, not
  the verify verdict, which is a fact about you. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_your_own_tool_can_be_the_false_outage.md`
- **Classify a repeated literal by the QUESTION each site answers, not its syntactic role.** The
  `"Player"` nick literal sits at 7 sites that look like one group and are two — and the axis is **MY
  NAME vs SOMEONE ELSE'S**, not default-vs-fallback. `SanitizeNickname`'s empty fallback
  (`player_handshake.cpp:253` — re-cited 2026-07-28; the row read `:224`, and `:219` before that,
  which is three drifts and a standing argument for citing the SYMBOL over the line) reads as a
  fallback but decides *my* displayed name; changing too few ships two different defaults, changing
  too many labels a nameless remote peer with your name. A 2026-07-27 re-census found
  `peer_action_feed.cpp:53` printing a NAMELESS REMOTE PEER with the MY-NAME literal — the trap, live.
  *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson_nick_default_axis_is_mine_vs_theirs.md`
- **A destructive UI action correlates by CONTENT, never by a snapshot-time index.** A
  persistent-until-dismissed report ages while it sits on screen; any unrelated write shifts line
  numbers/row ids, and a stale index deletes the WRONG target — or BOTH copies of a duplicate
  identity key (the example was `player_guid`, RETIRED in b144 -- `player_skin` is the live
  CFG_IDENTITY row and carries the same risk → orphaned inventory / lost skin), with `removed==0` guards blind to
  "matched-but-wrong". Carry the VALUE the user clicked, re-validate it exists at act time, refuse +
  re-sweep on a vanish (arc-2 audit CRIT-2, fixed `7f1765ea`; drill G). *Look FIRST:*

- **Public claim surfaces (the website, the README) carry the same verdict-axis discipline as status
  docs (2026-07-26, the 13-round site /qf).** Every marketing VERB is a status claim ("is played
  together" over a smoke-only chain = false-PROVEN; "Kerfur works for everyone" survived on its HO
  row), every NUMBER needs a code anchor ("up to 4" → `kMaxPeers=4`), every image CAPTION must match
  the pixels (3 of 6 first drafts were false), retracted phrasings resurrect from the copy-SOURCE
  unless annotated at the phrase, and the surfaces must be diffed against EACH OTHER (site↔README:
  install path, player count). *Look FIRST:*

- **Site dev-loop instruments lie in THREE measured ways (2026-07-26, +1 on 2026-07-27):**
  `zola serve`'s Windows watcher silently misses external edits (serves STALE memory bytes;
  `public/` is not refreshed by serve at all, and a `zola build` run BESIDE a live serve does not
  change what serve returns — only a restart does) → curl the served asset vs disk, restart zola,
  always fresh `zola build` before deploy; headless Chrome (legacy AND new) clamps its layout to a
  ~500px minimum window → a 360px screenshot fakes mobile overflow that no real phone shows; and
  **zola MINIFIES the built HTML**, so `grep 'id="qa"' public/index.html` false-negatives on
  `id=qa` and, since the page is ONE line, `grep -c` caps at 1 — a 2026-07-27 false negative was
  stated to the user as "the site has no Q&A section" when it had five. Grep the TEMPLATE, or use
  an attribute-agnostic pattern plus `grep -o | wc -l`. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_site_dev_instruments_stale_serve_and_chrome_clamp.md`
- **Ask before changing the user's system/network settings (USER CORRECTION 2026-07-26).** A correct
  diagnosis (stale upstream DNS cache) is not a license to reconfigure the machine: the elevated
  DNS-to-1.1.1.1 change got an immediate "верни как было" — the router does local DNS the bypass
  would break. Read-only probes are free; any write outside the project tree (DNS, services,
  firewall profiles, registry) = name the change + ask, offer the in-place alternative (here:
  restarting the router's Unbound, which is what worked). *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/feedback_ask_before_changing_user_system_settings.md`
- **A census of ONE operation KIND reads as a complete census of the path.** Enumerating every
  *widening* conversion on the nickname path was exhaustive — for widening — and therefore FELT
  complete, while four raw *truncations* on the same path stayed invisible for fifteen `/qf` rounds
  (`config.cpp:508` `resize(255)`; `player_handshake.cpp:302` and `:573` `resize(200)` AFTER `ToUtf8`;
  `SanitizeNickname:212` capping in UTF-16 units — **all four are RETIRED as of `9ae83454`**: the caps
  are `coop::text::CapUtf8Bytes` / `CapCodepoints` and `tools/text/nick_gate.ps1` polices the verb). Two of them would have manufactured the ill-formed
  UTF-8 that the same design's new fail-closed receive boundary rejects — the feature would have broken
  its own sender's nick and looked like a wire bug. Grep per VERB (`resize`, `substr`, `memcpy`,
  `snprintf`, `WideCharToMultiByte`), not per concept; and prefer a TYPE owning capacity + truncation
  over a corrected list of sites. **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-27 (arc A):** the design's census of
  `peerConns_` write sites listed FIVE; there are SEVEN — it grepped `.store(` and both
  `.exchange(0)` clears (`Session::Stop`, `Session::Kick`) were invisible. Kick's was load-bearing:
  without its generation clear a kicked slot keeps a live occupancy token and the ledger never
  empties the row. The repair was to mechanise the census by OPERATION KIND —
  `tools/net/peerconn_gate.ps1` requires a `GEN: mint|clear|none -- <why>` annotation at every
  mutating verb, FAILS on a zero-site census (a gate that finds nothing has gone blind, and green is
  not evidence), and carries six fixture must-fire controls. It immediately caught the author's OWN
  eighth site (`KickWithToken`'s compare-exchange) and refused to build. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_census_the_operation_kind_not_only_the_sites.md`
- **An EDGE detector on state a peer cannot observe is silently DEAD, not wrong.**
  `subsystems::DisconnectSlot` — ~20 per-slot person-state teardowns — hung off a falling edge of
  `IsSlotReady`. On a CLIENT that latch never RISES for slots 1-3 (a client only fills
  `peerConns_[0]`), so the whole fan-out never executed there for the life of the project: a
  departed third peer's voice channel, prop/owner-entity mirrors, trash proxies, flashlight cache and
  Player Element survived to session end, frozen puppet still standing. A dead handler leaves NO
  evidence — no wrong value, no warning — and it works perfectly on the host, which is where anyone
  debugging looks. Ask, PER ROLE, whether the predicate is structurally reachable; transport-derived
  predicates are asymmetric by construction. The repair shape is always the same: replace the edge
  with a comparison against a VALUE both peers hold. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_an_edge_that_never_rises_never_fires.md`
- **Baseline an instrument on something the system does not reset under it.** Three consecutive
  harness bugs while building the arc-A departure drill, each of which made it test NOTHING while
  looking like progress: `multivoid.log` is APPENDED across runs (so the previous run's roster
  matched and the drill fired before any peer existed), then it turned out to be ROTATED at boot
  (so the line-count baseline fixing that could never be exceeded and the wait hung), and `smoke4`'s
  default monitor window expired and killed the peers mid-settle. Also `Get-Process VotV` finds
  nothing — the image is `VotV-Win64-Shipping`, `VotV (Client)` is only the window TITLE. Cue on what
  you CONTROL (the process set), grade on what you MEASURE (the log); never both on one artifact. A
  drill that cannot tell "nothing to test" from "passed" is worse than no drill. *Look FIRST:*

- **MID-ACTIVITY JOIN is ALWAYS handled, per RULE 1 — it is architectural principle 8** (USER RULE
  2026-07-19). A peer joining mid-event / mid-decode / mid-download / mid-ping / mid-playback /
  mid-drive / mid-ANYTHING is never an unsupported edge case. Every sync lane MUST define and
  implement its late-join answer (snapshot / seed / park / replay / unlatch) AT THE ROOT; "don't join
  during X", a suppressive filter, or an undefined window is a crutch. A new lane is not DONE until
  its mid-join row exists. *Look FIRST:* the per-lane answer table in `docs/COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md` — it
  is the pattern, and it extends to every activity lane, not just events.
  `memory/feedback_mid_activity_join_per_rule1.md`

- **AUTO-RUNBOOKS: where a check needs EYES, SCREENSHOT it — don't hand the check back** (USER RULE
  2026-07-27: *"Where you need eyes you should just screenshot and point to me those screens, thats
  how we are going to run auto handbooks from now on."*). Writing "whether it LOOKS right is
  irreducibly human" into a runbook is the wrong output. Drive the scenario autonomously, capture at
  the DECISION MOMENT, and put the picture in front of the user — their job is the verdict on the
  picture, not operating the game to produce it. Only what a picture cannot carry (a felt hitch, a
  between-frames flicker, subjective smoothness over minutes) stays manual, and must be NAMED, never
  used as a catch-all for "I didn't build the capture". Photograph the peer where the BUG lived, not
  the convenient one — `mp.py scoreshot` captures the HOST roster, which was never broken.
  Corollary (same user, same day): **"an autonomous run can't press X" is almost never true — check
  before adding a dev bypass.** We already drive bots that act in the world; the overlay owns a
  WndProc hook, so `PostMessage(hwnd, WM_KEYDOWN/KEYUP, vk, 0)` per window drives the real binding
  with no focus stealing across four peers (`SendInput` cannot). The `VOTVCOOP_SCOREBOARD_OPEN=1`
  bypass had been hiding two facts a real keypress exposes immediately: the player list is
  **tilde (`VK_OEM_3`), not TAB** (a runbook handed to the user said TAB throughout), and it is
  **hold-to-peek on a client, toggle on the host**. *Look FIRST:* `tools/net/roster_shot.ps1`.
  `memory/feedback_show_screens.md`

- **A readiness ANNOUNCEMENT is not evidence of the VISIBLE state it precedes.** Measured 2026-07-27:
  BOTH obvious "peer is ready" markers fire while the peer is still on a loading screen —
  `net_pump: ClientWorldReady announced` means the SYNC layer is satisfied and precedes the level
  `open` completing; `harness: ==== PLAY READY ====` fires earlier still. A screenshot gated on either
  caught CLIENT_3 behind the unclickable OMEGA content-warning screen, photographing "PLAYERS
  offline" — and a COUNT-based drill would have passed it, since the log had all four rows. Gate on an
  EFFECT that requires the state you need (another peer receiving this peer's pose stream ⇒ a live
  simulating pawn), preferably logged by a DIFFERENT component than the one you are waiting on. Also:
  size a hold in FRAMES not milliseconds — 600 ms was ~2 frames on a peer at 4.2 FPS.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-28, now with a NAMED mechanism:** `smoke_i18n` gated its chat typing on the
  peer's own `Joined X's game` line; client 3 logged it at 22:13:28 and still would not accept a
  keystroke ~16 s later, while demonstrably RECEIVING the other peers' messages. `CaptureActive()`
  (`ui/imgui_overlay.cpp:136`) counts `LoadingOpen()`, so the loading cover OWNS INPUT and swallows the
  `T` bind whole — a marker can be true about the SESSION and false about the INPUT PATH at the same
  instant. Same run, same shape: `VOTVCOOP_SCOREBOARD_OPEN=1` also lands in `CaptureActive()` via
  `ScoreOpen() && LocalIsHost()`, so **a fixture that opens a UI surface for a screenshot disabled the
  bind the test was about.** Sharpened rule: gate on an effect ON THE PATH YOU ARE ABOUT TO USE — if
  you are about to type, require the artifact (`chat: sent`) and FAIL rather than retry silently.

  cannot be clicked. `memory/lesson_readiness_announcements_precede_visible_state.md`

- **ONE COLUMN, TWO AXES — a fused display axis stays invisible until a SECOND viewpoint renders it.**
  Measured 2026-07-27 from the first 4-peer screenshot of the player list: `Link` fuses the peer's
  TRANSPORT to the session (LAN/P2P/relay) with MY ROUTE to that peer (direct vs host-relayed →
  "VIA HOST"). On the HOST's board the two coincide, so it looked coherent for as long as only the
  host listed peers; arc A made a CLIENT list them and the column then showed transport on two rows
  and routing on two others, on an all-LAN session. The client cannot fix it locally —
  `LinkLabelForSlot` reads `peerConns_[slot]`, which a client owns only for slot 0. Ask of every
  per-peer column: **is this a property OF that peer, or of MY relationship to them?** "VIA HOST" read
  as information, which is why it survived; a blank would have been caught sooner.
  **CORRECTED 2026-07-28 when it was fixed (v131):** the doc's own claim *"a client cannot fix it
  locally"* was FALSE — `session_status.cpp:491-494` bailed on `hConn == 0` **above** the
  `cfg_.topology` branch that returns `"LAN"` without needing any connection, so **an ownership
  bail-out placed above a config-derived answer is what made a shared fact look role-exclusive.**
  The publish rule still fires, but for the PING (per-connection in every topology, so no client can
  ever derive another client's) — visible as `--` in the same screenshot. And the `LAN` verdict was
  never a measurement either: a port-forwarded WAN peer printed `LAN`. **The rule the episode reduces
  to: publish or drop, never synthesise** — a coarser same-axis value shown everywhere is a scope
  decision; a different-axis value invented locally is a lie, and so is a plausible value nobody
  measured (a published host ping of `0` renders as `<1ms`). *Look FIRST:* `coop/net/link_kind.h`,
  `Session::LinkKindForSlot`, `ui/link_format.{h,cpp}`.
  `memory/lesson_one_column_two_axes_transport_vs_route.md`

- **AN INSTRUMENT BLIND TO THE PHENOMENON ALWAYS REPORTS "NOT PRESENT".** Measured 2026-07-28
  chasing the no-cursor bug: `tools/capture-window.ps1` does no `GetCursorInfo`/`DrawIconEx`
  compositing, so **no screenshot this repo has ever taken can show an OS cursor** — a capture is
  identical whether the bug exists or not. Stacked on top: ImGui's Win32 backend only updates
  `io.MousePos` when the window is **FOREGROUND**, so an unattended capture renders no software
  cursor *by construction* (the first probe run hit exactly this and looked like a clean repro).
  A negative is evidence **only if the instrument could have produced a positive**. *Look FIRST:*
  ask what the capture path physically records; pair every visual probe with a known-positive
  frame; for cursor-shaped questions prefer a state read (`GetCursorInfo` gives `flags` +
  `ptScreenPos`, which separates hidden from recentered — a photo cannot); and any focus-dependent
  measurement must `SetForegroundWindow` and ASSERT it took.
  **SECOND INSTANCE, DIFFERENT AXIS (2026-08-22, the RTSS/OBS overlay arc):** the blind spot is not
  always an omitted ELEMENT — it can be the wrong PIPELINE. The acceptance gate first proposed for
  "OBS can't capture our overlay" was `capture_window.ps1`, i.e. `PrintWindow`/`BitBlt` = the
  **DWM/GDI** path; OBS game-capture is an inline **Present-hook backbuffer copy**. The entire defect
  is about WHERE in the Present chain our pixels land, so a DWM grab cannot adjudicate it — only real
  OBS can. (The RTSS half of the same arc IS answerable by a window grab: "is the overlay in the
  rendered frame at all".) *Look FIRST, additionally:* **if the claim is about WHERE IN A CHAIN
  something happens, the instrument must live in that same chain.**
  **THIRD INSTANCE — A FILTER IS AN INSTRUMENT (2026-08-23, the crash-dump module list):**
  `tools/debug/parse_dump.py` printed "modules of interest" filtered by matching the **BASENAME**
  against a loader-shaped key set (`main.dll`/`ue4ss`/`shim`/`xinput`/`votv`/`dwmapi`/`crash`) —
  right for the question it was born for (which UE4SS mod is which), wrong for the question the 19:17
  dump was later re-read against (who else is on the DXGI Present chain). `NahimicOSD.dll` was loaded
  in that dump the whole time and **could not appear**: it matches none of those keys and lives in a
  vendor folder (`C:\ProgramData\A-Volute\...`) whose basename says nothing. Nastier than the camera
  cases because the tool is correct AND its output is a positive list, which reads as complete — a
  section headed "modules of interest" quietly asserts that what is absent is uninteresting. Fixed by
  matching the FULL PATH against a widened graphics/injector key set and printing the path.
  *Look FIRST:* **when you re-use a tool to ask a question it was not built for, audit its FILTER
  before you trust its silence.** SIXTH member (2026-08-23, the seeds drill's RED-1): a
  TIMING-dependent drill whose scripted action RACES the phenomenon's anchor -- the "in-window"
  email authored 3 s after connect landed BEFORE the save snapshot, rode the save, and the loss
  case silently went unexercised while the run "passed" arrival. The ORDERING is the phenomenon:
  assert the in-log ORDER (authored-line AFTER the "captured at blob instant" line), not arrival.
  SEVENTH member, the INVERSE polarity (2026-08-23, the smoke4 "relay gap"): a verdict window
  anchored on the last client's wire-CONNECT while the phenomenon (its first relayed pose) needs
  save transfer + world load + ~13 s ready→pose INSIDE it — the smoke save grew to ~19 MB and the
  window silently starved the last joiner, producing a false POSITIVE bug ("RELAY GAP") that got
  filed in three docs as pre-existing. Same bytes, 120 s window = clean PASS; relay healthy. Fix:
  anchor the window on every client's world-ready edge (mp.py `--ready-timeout`). *Look FIRST:*
  **a growing input (save/world/log) silently re-opens any wall-clock window that was once wide
  enough — anchor verdict windows on the pipeline's own settle edge, not on wall clock.**
  COROLLARY (same day, the R-2 acceptance): an instrument that PERTURBS the system contaminates
  the gate it certifies — ForceSyncFullPass's settle reset queued ~15 re-settle fulls and dragged
  the numeric gate 10.0x → 5.8x; force exactly the one action (a one-shot flag), never a state
  reset. The same drill falsified grime's "collision-free grid" comment by measurement
  (1,023 decals → 1,021 cells).
  EIGHTH member (2026-08-23 eve, R-2b): **a gate observable that counts ATTEMPTS at the call
  site cannot go red** — the reseed summary's `bumps=` was incremented beside
  `BumpSeedGeneration_()` instead of inside it past the mute; the RED-calibration run showed
  `bumps=19` with the generation FROZEN. The counter must live past every early-out of the
  mechanism it certifies; both R-2b instrument defects were caught ONLY by running the gates
  red/loaded, never by green paths.

  - *TWO MORE MEMBERS 2026-08-24 (A34), both about a SILENT instrument being indistinguishable from a DISABLED one, which cost two smoke runs in one session:* the `store_table_probe` ini key landed **inside a comment line**, so an empty log read as "ran, found nothing" rather than "never enabled" — it now warns once when ENABLED but unresolved; and `order_selftest`'s settle was a **tick count copied from another probe** (1800), which never elapsed inside a 26-second connected window because a "tick" here is a frame — it is now wall-clock and announces ARMED once. **If an instrument can be off, it must say when it is ON.**

- **A PER-ITEM TIME BUDGET THAT EXCLUDES THE AFTER-LOOP DELIVERY HALF IS NOT A BUDGET.**
  Measured 2026-08-23 (R-2b acceptance run 1): the reseed drain's ~1 ms QPC loop bounded
  nothing — `DeliverLateRegisteredProps` ran AFTER the loop on the whole chunk, landing ~800
  adoptions' payload+send on ONE tick (140/254 ms [WALK-TIME], the exact stall class the drain
  existed to remove); and a per-8-items clock check let 8 back-to-back ~170 us items overshoot
  2.4x. *Look FIRST:* any budgeted/sliced drain — verify the WHOLE per-item cost (including
  express/broadcast halves staged "for later") executes inside the clock check, granularity
  matched to the worst single item. Reference impl: `prop_census.cpp DrainReseedQueue`.

- **VERIFY ROLE-EXCLUSIVITY BEFORE INVOKING THE PUBLISH RULE — read the accessor top to bottom.**
  Measured 2026-07-28: a 15-round design pass was founded on "only the host can measure a peer's
  link". False. The accessor returned `"LAN"` from a session-wide CONFIG value that every peer holds;
  it merely returned early on `hConn == 0` first. The guard was about OWNERSHIP, the answer was about
  CONFIG, and the ordering made one look like the other. Cost: a wire field justified on the wrong
  grounds for four rounds. **The tell: a function that "can only be answered by role X" but whose
  answer body never touches anything role-specific.** *Look FIRST:* read the whole accessor before
  writing "only X can know this" in a design; and state which measured line makes it exclusive.
  `memory/lesson_verify_role_exclusivity_before_publishing.md`

- **A failing selftest is a claim about TWO things — check the EXPECTATION before the code.** Measured
  2026-07-28: the nickname-arbiter selftest failed 13/14 asserting a name the arbiter can never emit (a
  19-char stem + `"10"` is 21 characters, over the 20-cap) — the code was right, the test was wrong. The
  same day the codec selftest failed on `CountCodepoints(...) == 2` and that one was REAL but two layers
  down: MSVC without `/utf-8` decodes source literals with the SYSTEM codepage, so every non-ASCII
  literal in the tree was locale-dependent. Note which assertion caught it: every ROUND-TRIP case passed,
  because a round trip is self-consistent under a shared corruption. **Include at least one ABSOLUTE
  assertion per selftest**, and treat `/utf-8` as mandatory on MSVC. *Look FIRST:* re-derive the expected
  value by hand, constructing it the way the code numbers rather than the way it reads.
  `memory/lesson_a_selftest_expectation_can_be_the_bug.md`
- **A capability can be silently STRIPPED where you expected an assert — and no compiler control can see
  it.** *(Re-verified 2026-07-30 against **v1.92.9**: the strip is now `imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:**987**`, and
  `:894` additionally asserts "Only 1 simultaneous texture allowed with legacy ImGui_ImplDX12_Init()
  signature!". The finding is unchanged and was the decisive fact of the upgrade measurement — but note
  what it does NOT say: it is DX12-only, so a straight port ships **DX11 WITH the dynamic atlas and DX12
  without it**, i.e. one build with two drawable repertoires selected by the player's RHI.)*
  Measured 2026-07-28 pricing ImGui 1.92: `imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:984` (v1.92.8 line) does
  `io.BackendFlags &= ~ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` when the legacy `Init` signature is used. It
  does not assert; it degrades. The upgrade would have paid its whole cost (a submodule bump, a semantic
  sweep of four kept redirects) for none of its benefit — 16-64 MB and a 139-416 ms atlas rebuild instead
  of 0.25 MB — **DX12-only, clean compile, no warning**, on the RHI least likely to be tested. Worse, the
  headless probe SET THAT FLAG ON ITSELF, so it measured a configuration the product never reproduces
  (`grep RendererHasTextures src/` = zero). *Look FIRST:* when an upgrade's VALUE rests on a capability
  flag, grep the vendored backend for `&= ~<FLAG>` before believing any benefit number, and ship a boot
  assertion that the flag survived on EVERY backend.
  **UPDATED 2026-07-30: this row's recommendation is now BUILT** — `ui/atlas_watch.cpp` asserts the
  regime every frame and `tools/text/atlas_regime_gate.ps1` censuses it in CI, so do not re-propose
  it. Also stale in the fact base: `grep RendererHasTextures src/` no longer returns zero (the flag
  is READ by the watch and CLEARED nowhere, which is the point).

- **An upgrade can demote your INPUT to a hint, with a clean compile.** MEASURED 2026-07-30 against ImGui
  **1.92.9**: `ImFontConfig::GlyphRanges` — the array we pass on every font add, and on which arc D2's
  whole *"one generator mints both what FOLDS and what BAKES, so they cannot drift"* construction rests —
  is still a public field, still accepted, still warning-free, and **read in exactly ONE function**
  (`ImFontAtlasBuildLegacyPreloadAllGlyphRanges`, `imgui_draw.cpp:3540`) called only under
  `if (atlas->RendererHasTextures == false)` (`:3498-3499`). With the dynamic atlas on it bounds
  **nothing**: the atlas draws whatever the face cmap carries (8,148 cp for our faces vs the 2,517 we
  fold). The on-demand path doesn't consult it at all — `ImFontBaked_BuildLoadGlyph` (`:4562-4571`) gates
  only on `Locked`/`NoLoadGlyphs` and uses `GlyphExcludeRanges`, a **different field**. So a naming
  invariant is not violated but **DISSOLVED**, and a prior 9-row classified diff had filed this as
  *"ranges unnecessary — 1 site — and this is the win, not a cost"*. **CORRECTED 2026-07-30 by
  measurement:** the same-day corollary here claimed that because on-demand baking is not gated on the
  flag, a mechanical port keeping the old init is *"not behaviour-identical"*. **It is.**
  `UpdateFontsNewFrame` (`imgui.cpp:9089-9094`) turns the missing flag INTO `atlas->Locked`, which IS
  `BuildLoadGlyph`'s first test — so inside a legacy frame nothing bakes and drawing matches 1.91.5
  exactly (probe arm L: 7 out-of-repertoire codepoints unbaked, 0 texels diverged, `TexIsBuilt` held).
  The regime is a TIME WINDOW, and only code outside a frame escapes it —
  `[[lesson-a-capability-flag-may-be-a-per-frame-lock]]`. *Look FIRST:* grep the new version for **who
  READS each field you set**,
  not whether the field still exists; if the only reader sits behind a capability guard you now have two
  behaviours in one build. `memory/lesson_an_upgrade_can_demote_your_input_to_a_hint.md`

- **Querying a lazy cache POPULATES it — so the question you asked is not the one answered.** MEASURED
  2026-07-30: `ImFontBaked::FindGlyphNoFallback` (`imgui_draw.cpp:5361-5373`) sets `LoadNoFallback = true`
  and **calls `ImFontBaked_BuildLoadGlyph`**. The `NoFallback` in the name governs failure behaviour, not
  mutation. Under 1.91.5 the same call is a pure read of an eagerly-built atlas, so `ui/fonts.cpp`'s boot
  selftest means *"the eager bake included X"*; under 1.92 it means *"this face CAN produce X"* — a cmap
  fact `build_repertoire.py` already knows at generate time — and the instrument now **mutates its own
  subject** (four glyphs baked) before later assertions read atlas bytes. It does not become
  pass-by-construction (a codepoint no face carries still returns NULL, so `U+4E00` stays a valid RED) but
  its verdict must be **relabelled or it lies about what it proves**. **RESOLVED 2026-07-30 (`b33aae30`), and the damage was bigger than a label:** the bake also flips `TexIsBuilt` to false, and a legacy backend uploads once, so from that one query EVERY later frame raises the `imgui_draw.cpp:2815` user error permanently. The fix was NOT a relabel — the assertions were split by what they actually ask: *"can this build DRAW X"* -> `ImFont::IsGlyphInFont` (`imgui_draw.cpp:5391`, a pure cmap walk, which is what finally made a RED case possible: `U+4E00` must be ABSENT), and *"did a COLOURED emoji reach the texture"* -> a baked lookup behind a helper that REFUSES any codepoint outside the repertoire. *Look FIRST:* before founding an
  assertion on an accessor into any lazily-populated store, open the accessor body and check for a
  build/insert on the miss path. Sibling: `[[lesson-a-fallback-glyph-must-be-asked-for]]` — presence in the
  FONT is not presence in the ATLAS, and now asking about the atlas changes it.
  **UPDATED 2026-07-30 (`0d84cc5a`): the cited code MOVED.** The selftest is no longer in
  `ui/fonts.cpp` — it lives in `ui/atlas_watch.cpp`, runs IN-FRAME, and the "refuse any codepoint
  outside the repertoire" helper is RETIRED (post-flip it would have made the only COLR instrument
  green-by-skip). It now bakes one emoji deliberately; every presence check is cmap-only
  (`IsGlyphInFont`). The lesson's core — querying a lazy cache POPULATES it — is unchanged.
  `memory/lesson_querying_a_lazy_cache_populates_it.md`

- **A clean build after a major dependency bump may be riding OBSOLETE SHIMS.** MEASURED 2026-07-30:
  building the whole mod against ImGui 1.92.9 gave errors in only 3 UI files — and three call sites a
  prior classified diff had listed as breaks produced **no error at all**, because `imgui.h:4133` keeps
  `inline void PushFont(ImFont*)` (plus `CalcWordWrapPositionA` at `:3968` and `SetWindowFontScale`) inside
  `#ifndef IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS` — even though the same header says the single-arg version was
  *"REMOVED"*. The same diff's *"`GetTexDataAsRGBA32`/`Build`/`IsBuilt` obsoleted — **zero** sites — free"*
  row was **wrong in the other direction**: 10 references to removed *fields* (`TexPixelsRGBA32`/`TexWidth`/
  `TexHeight`) plus an explicit `io.Fonts->Build()`. A changelog + call-site grep mis-prices in BOTH
  directions (shims absorb rows; a removed FIELD never appears in a list of removed FUNCTIONS), and its
  line numbers rot (a cited file didn't exist yet). *Look FIRST:* **don't price a bump from the changelog —
  build it** as a throwaway spike (snapshot beside the pin, `-D<DEP>_DIR`, keep the log, revert), then
  **build again with the obsolete layer OFF** — only the second build shows the true migration surface.
  Every surviving shim call is RULE-2 baggage with its own line in the plan.
  `memory/lesson_a_clean_upgrade_build_may_be_riding_obsolete_shims.md`

- **A capability flag can be implemented as a per-frame LOCK, so "the regime" has a TIME WINDOW.**
  MEASURED 2026-07-30 (ImGui 1.92.9): `ImFontBaked_BuildLoadGlyph` (`imgui_draw.cpp:4562-4571`) gates on
  `atlas->Locked`, never on `ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasTextures` — which reads as "the dynamic atlas is
  ungated". But `UpdateFontsNewFrame` (`imgui.cpp:9089-9094`) does
  `if (flag == 0) atlas->Locked = true`, and `UpdateFontsEndFrame` (`:6173-6175`) clears it. So the flag
  IS the gate, one indirection away, **for the duration of a frame only.** Inside a legacy frame nothing
  bakes (7 out-of-repertoire codepoints unbaked, 0 texels diverged, `TexIsBuilt` held); **outside** one,
  a single `FindGlyphNoFallback` bakes AND flips `TexIsBuilt` to 0, after which every later frame raises
  the `imgui_draw.cpp:2815` user error forever, because a legacy backend uploads once. The victim is real:
  `ui/fonts.cpp`'s boot selftest runs from `Load()`, before `ImGui_ImplWin32_Init`, always outside a frame.
  A probe that inspected AFTER `Render()` "confirmed" the wrong answer — it measured its own instrument.
  **SECOND MECHANISM, same flag, measured 2026-07-30 in the implementation `/qf`: it is also SAMPLED at
  an INSTANT during init.** `ImFontAtlasBuildUpdateRendererHasTexturesFromContext`
  (`imgui_draw.cpp:2760-2772`, called from `ImFontAtlasBuildMain` at `:3497`) copies the flag off the
  context at build time and decides the legacy preload from the copy — and `ui::fonts::Load()`
  (`imgui_overlay.cpp:295`) runs **eight lines before** the backend sets it inside `InitRenderer`
  (`imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:931` via `:303`). So deleting the clears would have flipped every LATER build and
  left the **boot** atlas eagerly preloaded, with `GlyphRanges` still load-bearing exactly where it had
  been declared dead. Upstream names it by hand at `imgui_draw.cpp:2818`. Fix = an ORDERING change, and
  it makes boot match a path already exercised every session (`MaybeRescale` calls `Load()` with the
  backend live). *Look FIRST:* ask **when** a regime holds, not just whether; grep for who WRITES the
  derived state, not only who reads the flag; **ask at what INSTANT the flag is sampled** — setting it
  after something has already copied it is indistinguishable, at the setting site, from setting it in
  time; and take a probe's observation **inside the same window** as the behaviour it claims to
  describe. **UPDATED 2026-07-30: our build no longer runs the locked regime** — both clears are
  deleted (`0d84cc5a`), so `atlas->Locked` stays false and glyphs bake during the frame. The
  out-of-frame victim this row names (`fonts.cpp`'s boot selftest) no longer exists.
  `memory/lesson_a_capability_flag_may_be_a_per_frame_lock.md`

- **The subsystem you are about to build may ALREADY BE RUNNING.** MEASURED 2026-07-30: four `/qf` rounds
  designed a ~200 LOC DX12 texture-servicing subsystem to replace `ImGui_ImplDX12_UpdateTexture`, whose
  every upload ends in `WaitForSingleObject(..., INFINITE)` (`imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:564-565`) on our render
  thread where every wait we own is bounded at 2000 ms. Round 5 measured that
  `imgui.cpp:5973` assigns `draw_data->Textures` **unconditionally** and both backends service that list
  **ungated by the capability flag** (`imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:236`, `imgui_impl_dx11.cpp:181`) — so the path
  "we were going to replace" already executes at boot and twice per rescale on a 16 MB upload, in the
  shipped build, **and had never been timed**. Every justification was a property of the POST-flip
  regime, so the subsystem was justified only by what the flip enables; and the leak it had to fix was
  one **it introduced itself** by taking ownership of a resource ImGui frees correctly. The flag gates
  the capability's QUALITY (incremental updates), not its INVOCATION. *Look FIRST:* before designing a
  replacement, grep the incumbent's call sites and ask what actually gates them — not what the flag's
  NAME implies — and if its cost is unmeasured, ship a 15-line timed wrapper at the same seam instead:
  it produces the number AND occupies exactly the seam the replacement would.
  `memory/lesson_the_subsystem_you_are_about_to_build_may_already_be_running.md`

- **An upstream assert your build STRIPS is not a guard.** MEASURED 2026-07-30: our Release build defines
  `NDEBUG`, so every ImGui `IM_ASSERT` compiles away — and THREE invariants the flip design leaned on
  exist *only* as asserts: the `GlyphExcludeRanges` 64-element cap (`imgui_draw.cpp:3115`), the atlas
  pack-failure check (`:4818`, whose `return false` degrades to **the fallback box** — symptom-identical
  to the bug the whole glyph saga exists to remove), and *"backend set Destroyed but did not clear
  TexID"* (`:2875`, the one that let a per-rescale resource+descriptor leak through a design that had
  already passed several rounds). All three fail SILENTLY. *Look FIRST:* grep how a dependency's
  invariant is ENFORCED, not whether it is stated; move the check to a layer you control (a generator
  `sys.exit` for offline data, a CI source gate for structure, our own predicate at runtime); for a
  silent-degradation invariant build a DETECTOR and prove it distinguishes the failure from the ordinary
  state that looks the same; and never sit exactly on a stripped limit (the semantically-widest exclusion
  set landed on precisely 32 of 32 permitted ranges — the set with four ranges of margin was chosen for
  that reason alone). `memory/lesson_an_upstream_assert_your_build_strips_is_not_a_guard.md`

- **A comment citing a DEPENDENCY's line number rots silently, and the confident ones rot worst.**
  MEASURED 2026-07-30 (`683f8214`): `ui/fonts.cpp` carried TWO such comments and the `v1.91.5 -> v1.92.9`
  bump invalidated both. `:175` credited *"imgui_freetype.cpp:515 refuses to overwrite a glyph an earlier
  source already provided"* for the merge-order policy — `:515` is now FreeType render-mode selection and
  the refusal is gone, though the POLICY survives at `ImFontBaked_BuildLoadGlyph`
  (`imgui_draw.cpp:4590-4602`), so the conclusion was right and all its evidence was dead. `:400` cited
  `GetTexDataAsRGBA32` + `TexPixelsRGBA32`, **neither of which appears anywhere in the 1.92.9 DX11/DX12
  backends**, and closed with *"do not 'simplify' by removing the GetTexData path"* — a stale comment
  that **forbids**, costing the next reader the dig plus the confidence to act. Same file, same bump:
  `built ? ... : "FAILED TO BAKE"` is unreachable because `Build()` returns true unconditionally. *Look
  FIRST:* after any submodule bump, grep your own tree for citations INTO the dependency and re-verify
  each; cite the SYMBOL and let the line number be a convenience; state the OUTCOME you rely on
  separately from the MECHANISM you observed; and never close a comment by telling the reader not to
  change the thing — if it is load-bearing make it a test, a gate or a `static_assert`.
  **SECOND INSTANCE, 2026-08-25, and it was OUR OWN file rotted by an ADDITIVE change:** adding one
  public seam — `SpawnUObject`, **8 lines inserted at `engine_widget.cpp:287`** — shifted everything
  below it and silently invalidated **seven** citations across **three** files the commit never
  touched (`365-432`→`373-500` twice, `394-400`/`394-424`→`403-409`/`403-433`, `452-482`→`451-470`,
  `454-458`→`463-466`, `484`→`492-495`), including one inside `sdk_profile_names.h`. Two more were
  already wrong and had never been caught — `154-167` (really `157-170`) and `imgui_overlay.cpp:323`
  (really `324`, **off by one from the day it was written**). *Look FIRST:* **"did I edit that
  function?" is the wrong question — the right one is "did I change the LINE COUNT of any file
  anyone cites into?"**, and for a well-cited file the answer is yes for essentially any addition.
  After any such commit, `grep -rn "<basename>:[0-9]" docs/ src/ include/` and re-verify each hit;
  it is mechanical, not a judgement call.
  **SHARPENED 2026-08-26 -- the trigger "after a submodule bump" is TOO NARROW, and the ratio is the
  finding.** `docs/LESSONS.md` is an append-ANYWHERE ledger, so a row inserted near its top renumbers
  every line beneath it: one 17-line insert at `:36` silently invalidated every `LESSONS.md:<N>`
  citation in the tree, in the same session, with nothing failing. `[V]` The census
  (`grep -rnoE "LESSONS\.md:[0-9]+"` over `docs/ src/ tools/ CLAUDE.md`) found 5 -- and **3 of the 4
  live ones were ALREADY wrong before anything was touched**: `DOCS_ARC` cited `:727` for a literal
  that lives at `:1146`; `movement_ledger.cpp:98` cited `:1019` for a row about something else
  entirely; `security/TRACKER.md` cited `:1914` likewise. Only `UE4SS_ARC`'s `:240` was correct, and
  my own edit broke it. The fifth, `input_owner.h:24`, was IMMUNE -- because a previous session had
  been burned at that exact spot and converted it to a title citation. So this is not an event a bump
  triggers; it is the steady state of every line-number citation, noticed only when someone follows
  one. All four converted to TITLE citations. *Look FIRST:* the project had already written the cure
  a second time and not generalised it -- `[V]` `UE4SS_ARC` says of a thrice-re-cited CMake line
  **"STOP WRITING THE NUMBER: grep `add_library(xinput1_3`"**. Cite a symbol, a row TITLE, or the grep
  that finds it; a number survives neither a bump nor an insert.
  `memory/lesson_a_comment_citing_a_dependency_line_number_rots_silently.md`

- **A correction in a NEW SUBSECTION leaves the headline stale — and the headline is what gets quoted.**
  MEASURED 2026-07-30: a design doc's §2.7 led with *"+4,772 codepoints"* while §2.7a **immediately
  below**, titled *"computed for real"*, said **+5,078**. Both stood one screen apart for a session, and
  the stale figure had already propagated to a second doc (`votv-nickname-arbitration-...-2026-07-27.md`
  :1293) **citing §2.7** — the correction was invisible to whoever copied it. `+4,772` reproduces under
  **none** of five set-algebra formulations the generator's own tables can build, so it was never a
  measurement: an unlabelled ESTIMATE that a real computation replaced without deleting. A third value
  (+5,164) is also legitimate under a different subtraction, so each number now has to carry its
  CONSTRUCTION. The append-only instinct is right for reasoning and wrong for values. *Look FIRST:* edit
  the ORIGINAL sentence and put the correction note inside the same section; `grep` the tree for the
  figure you just retired before finishing; and label estimate-vs-measurement at the moment of writing.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-25, and the worse shape: the supersession note EXISTED and was CORRECT —
  it just lived in the superseding section.** `UE4SS_ARC.md` §7.6 ended *"that argues for shipping
  skins as a **separate package**"*; §7.7c part 1, ~180 lines below, recorded the user's opposite
  decision and said outright *"this supersedes the 'ship skins separately' suggestion in §7.6"*. §7.6
  itself carried no mark and read as current — so two days later **Claude wrote two new sections of
  that same file and cited §7.6's recommendation as live, twice**, one of them calling a freshly
  measured size gap *"the strongest practical argument for §7.6's conclusion"*. Pointing FORWARD from
  the new text protects nobody: readers reach §7.6 from a grep, a heading list or a cross-doc
  citation, and never see §7.7c. *Look FIRST, for an overturned DECISION:* the stamp goes on the
  **superseded** text (both ends need marking, only one is optional); **strike** the retired sentence
  rather than leaving it plain; **keep the rationale, retire the conclusion** — §7.6's premise (a
  third-party takedown removes the whole mod) stayed TRUE and was a risk ACCEPTED, so deleting it
  would have invited re-deriving the split, while leaving it unmarked invited quoting it; and before
  citing any section, grep the file for a supersession note aimed at it — reading top-to-bottom does
  not protect you when the note is 180 lines away.

- **A legacy wrapper is not a translation shim — read what it does AFTER the forward call.** MEASURED
  2026-07-30: `ImGui_ImplDX12_Init(device, frames, fmt, heap, cpu, gpu)` looks like an adapter onto the
  `InitInfo` overload, but its body (`imgui_impl_dx12.cpp:961-987`) also **creates its own command queue**
  (`:973`, `commandQueueOwned = true`) and **strips `RendererHasTextures`** (`:987`). So migrating to
  `InitInfo` silently ENABLED the dynamic atlas for DX12 only — one build, two drawable repertoires chosen
  by the player's RHI, where two peers would agree who collided and disagree what the names LOOK like. It
  was caught by a **runtime artifact**, not by reading: the second `Load()` logged
  `atlas baked in 0.0 ms (512x128)` against DX11's `1024x2048 in 72.7 ms` — a capability turning on makes
  a SMALLER, FASTER artifact, which reads like an improvement. The font selftest could not catch it (its
  lookups are guarded to in-repertoire codepoints, and a lazy atlas just bakes those). *Look FIRST:* open
  the legacy overload's body and read past the forward call; treat every parameter it SYNTHESISED as a
  decision you now own, not a blank to fill with the nearest handle.
  `memory/lesson_a_legacy_wrapper_does_more_than_translate.md`

- **A generated build constant must not be derived from data the TOOLCHAIN supplies.** MEASURED
  2026-07-30: widening the nickname fold table needs "subtract codepoints that render no ink", and the
  principled source is Unicode general category. But `Cn` (unassigned) covers **412 codepoints in our own
  fonts' cmaps** according to the generator machine's Python (3.11 ships Unicode **14.0.0**; `U+1CC21` and
  the `U+1CD00` block were assigned in Unicode 16). Subtracting them would fold visibly-distinct names to
  the sentinel AND make the fold table **a function of the generator's Python version** — two builds cut
  from one commit on two machines disagreeing about which player names collide, which is exactly the
  machine-dependence arc D2 exists to prevent, arriving through the toolchain instead of the font. `Cn` is
  NOT subtracted; the narrow set (`Cc/Cf/Cs/Zl/Zp/Zs` minus `U+0020`) is 105 codepoints and contains all
  33 of the shipped no-ink defect without naming one. Found only because the number was **computed instead
  of estimated** (+5,078, not the design's unrecorded +4,772 guess). *Look FIRST:* for every input to a
  generated constant ask "is this a property of the artifact, or of the tool reading it?", and assert the
  result's count/max so a data-table bump fails the build.

- **A drill whose inputs stay UNDER the threshold proves the half that was never broken.** MEASURED
  2026-07-28: arc D1 shipped "Cyrillic nicknames work", photographed with `Пельмень` — 8 characters,
  **16 UTF-8 bytes**, comfortably under the **23-byte** buffer cliff that BLANKED the roster row at 12
  Cyrillic characters (`WideCharToMultiByte` returns 0 on overflow; it does not truncate). Every drill
  name passed by being short. And the photograph framed the **TAB board** — while the request had
  literally named the **floating nameplate**, which was still rendering `????????` and had never once
  appeared in a drill shot. *Look FIRST:* derive the drill input from the CODE's boundary
  (`cap/bytes_per_unit + 1`), never from a plausible-looking example; and require one frame per SURFACE
  the change touches — a shot of a different surface is not weak evidence for this one, it is none.
  State the input's MAGNITUDE in the evidence line, not just its script.
  `memory/lesson_a_drill_that_stays_under_the_threshold_proves_the_wrong_half.md`

- **A gate that polices ONE verb makes the whole path look policed.** MEASURED 2026-07-28:
  `tools/text/nick_gate.ps1` — fail-closed, positive-controlled, and whose header **quotes** "grep the
  VERB, not the concept" — policed only `resize|substr` and sat GREEN over four shipped NARROW defects
  on the same lane (a `WideCharToMultiByte` blanking two surfaces, an ASCII squash on the nameplate, a
  filter dropping a name from a record), plus a fifth latent owner it could not see at all because a
  literal `char nick[24]` is a *declaration*, not an operation. Citing a lesson is not applying it: one
  verb reads as "the verb" to whoever writes it. *Look FIRST:* enumerate the lane's verbs exhaustively
  before the first pattern (truncate / narrow / widen / copy-into-fixed / declare-a-width), state in the
  header which are NOT covered, and **injection-prove every detector against the exact code you retired**
  — a gate that has only ever been green is an assertion, not a measurement.
  **SECOND OCCURRENCE 2026-07-28 (same gate, new dimension):** the widened gate still keys on the
  RECEIVER'S SPELLING (`\bnick[A-Za-z0-9_]*\.`), so `nickname_arbiter.cpp:37`'s `stem.substr(0, keep)`
  — a UTF-16-unit cut that can split a surrogate pair — is invisible and the gate is green and blind
  again. **A gate must key on the operation's SUBJECT (what the value IS), never on what the variable
  is CALLED**; a naming convention is not an invariant. Tell: a domain noun used as an identifier
  prefix inside a regex that is meant to prove a property.

- **A question handed to you to DECIDE can be MALFORMED — check its premise before answering.**
  Measured 2026-07-28: a design carried an "open product boundary" for days ("which hanzi set counts as
  common **also decides which NAMES are accepted**"), it survived a 19-round pass, and the user
  delegated it explicitly. The premise was false against HEAD — `SanitizeNickname` had become a
  DENYLIST the same day, so every hanzi and emoji was already accepted and the font set decided
  nothing. Answering it would have produced a converged answer to a question that had stopped
  mattering. *Look FIRST:* an open boundary inherited across passes is `carried-framing`, not a fact —
  **re-derive its PREMISE against the code before treating the question as the work.** The tell is a
  premise phrased as a consequence ("X *also decides* Y"): that clause is a claim about code and it is
  one grep away. `memory/lesson_a_delegated_question_can_be_malformed.md`
- **Oscillation on an axis means the axis is not what decided it.** Measured 2026-07-28: a `/qf` pass
  flipped FOUR times on demand-vs-eager font baking (R8 delete, R9 restore, R10 kill, R11 restore),
  every flip backed by a real fresh measurement and none of them converging. R12 found the actual
  contradiction, which was not on that axis: the thing demand existed to afford (CJK) had been rejected
  on **NEED**, and every later round re-argued **MECHANISM** — so re-admitting it on *affordability* was
  smuggling. *Look FIRST:* treat the **second** reversal on one axis as a stop signal, then stop arguing
  the axis and write side by side (a) the ground the dependent decision was originally rejected on and
  (b) the axis you are now arguing. Different words = you cannot converge, only smuggle. State the
  original ground in the next brief so the critic can test it. And **disclose the oscillation in the
  write-up** — the record of what was deleted and why is what stops the next session re-deriving all
  four positions. **SECOND OCCURRENCE 2026-07-29, and the stop signal was missed by FOUR reversals:** a
  chat-history `/qf` argued "where a retained line's nick colour is captured, and from which live table"
  across rounds 13-18, and *every round's fix replaced the previous one* (bake-at-push -> bake-at-
  retirement -> push-inversion -> palette merge -> neutral colour -> user says "no visual distinction").
  Six rounds, four reversals, **net diff ZERO**. Two sharpenings: (a) **every round being individually
  correct is not progress** — only the reversal COUNT is evidence; (b) **if four engineering fixes have
  failed on one axis, ask whether the question was ever engineering's to answer** — round 17's
  "dissolution" was a look-and-feel call, and it collapsed in one message once it went to the user.
  `memory/lesson_oscillation_means_the_axis_is_not_what_decided_it.md`
- **A red verdict can be the INSTRUMENT's defect, not the feature's.** Measured 2026-07-29:
  `smoke_i18n` reported six failures of the form "HOST: never saw 'привет всем' -- it was blanked,
  squashed or truncated somewhere on the way", against a log holding every line byte-intact and a chat
  lane working end-to-end on four scripts. Root: `tools/mp.py:1345` `_log_count` called
  `read_text(errors="replace")` with **no `encoding=`**, so a RU Windows box decoded the UTF-8 log as
  cp1251 and every non-ASCII needle compared against mojibake (0 hits -> 2/9 after the fix, `781245b1`).
  Every other `read_text` in that file passed the encoding; this was the single escapee, and the one the
  whole i18n verdict rests on. *Look FIRST:* the blind-instrument lesson trains suspicion of GREEN —
  **red is unaudited**, and here the failure text plausibly named a defect class the project HAD shipped
  the day before. Reproduce the assertion against the raw artifact with an explicit encoding before
  believing it; and in a file where most call sites pass an option, grep for the ones that don't.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-30, different root (fixed `c142d077`):** the same scenario failed the same six rows on BYTE-IDENTICAL DLLs — run 1 `FAIL (6)`, run 2 `PASS`, differing only in how long the last client took to join (35 s vs 21 s). The messages were never SENT: `T` is swallowed while any interactive surface owns input, and the gate was a `"Joined "` log line plus a flat 4 s sleep. It cost a detour hunting a font regression from the ImGui port that had landed minutes earlier. *Fix, and the generalisable part:* an instrument that INJECTS a stimulus must confirm the stimulus ARRIVED before judging the response — the sender renders its own chat line, so its own log is a receipt; wait for it and retype. A readiness gate plus a fixed sleep is a guess with a timestamp, and it fails in the direction that looks like a product bug. `memory/lesson_an_instrument_can_fail_the_feature_it_tests.md`
- **A drill on ONE TERM OF AN `||` is blind unless every other term is false — and a config DEFAULT
  decides that.** Measured 2026-07-29: a design narrowed `chat_feed::HasAny()` to fix an overlay-frame
  leak and specified four drills; all four would have PASSED on a broken build, because `hud.cpp:319-328`
  `IsActive()` is a disjunction whose last term is `voice_chat::Enabled()` (`:328`), and
  `config_registry_rows.inc:135` defaults `voice.enabled` to **true** (every smoke log shows voice
  starting on every peer). The term under test was unreachable; the defect would have shipped, visible
  only to a player who turns voice off. *Look FIRST:* when the change under test is one term of an OR
  (or one guard in a chain), **enumerate the other terms and find each one's DEFAULT before writing the
  drill** — "every other term false" is a precondition and belongs in the drill spec. Grep the config
  registry for the default, not the code for the flag. And ask who chose the drill's environment: if the
  answer is "whatever the harness does", you are testing the default configuration, which is exactly
  where the bug hides. `memory/lesson_an_environment_default_can_mask_the_thing_under_test.md`
- **Derive a probe's WORST CASE from the dedup key, never from a hand-written row.** Measured
  2026-07-28: `atlas_probe`'s `kWorstFamilyForRole = {0,1,2,3,0}` reads as "every role a different
  family" but hands Toast the same family as Menu, producing **4** faces where the ceiling is **5**
  (four roles share `(16 px, regular)` so four families give four faces; Chat is `(18 px, BOLD)` and can
  never dedup with them). A committed measurements doc then recorded 4 as the ceiling, understating
  every worst-case cell **2x in VRAM and 1.75x in time** — while the default cells stayed correct, which
  is why nothing looked wrong. *Look FIRST:* any instrument row labelled worst / max / ceiling / bound is
  a CLAIM; derive it from the dedup key and assert the probe reaches it (`faces == expected`).
  `memory/lesson_derive_a_probes_worst_case_from_the_dedup_key.md`

- **A log line can VANISH because of its arguments — and then every log-driven gate lies "broken".**
  Measured 2026-07-28: `%ls` in `std::vsnprintf` converts wide→narrow through the C locale, which
  encodes nothing above U+007F; the call returns −1 and MSVC leaves the buffer **empty**, so
  `ue_wrap::log::Write` emitted a bare `[21:04:18] [INFO ] ` with no message. Every line naming a
  Cyrillic, CJK or emoji peer had been vanishing whole since the first Cyrillic nickname — including
  `nickname_arbiter: slot N asked … -> assigned …`, the decision line of the entire naming arc. The
  first arc-D2 gate run therefore reported a **RELAY GAP** (`mp.py` greps
  `roster: client installed cross-peer identity slot=(\d+)`, which had been deleted by the formatter),
  and two runs were spent de-braiding a product failure that did not exist. Probe: `%ls` of `"Пел"` →
  `n=-1`; via `_create_locale(LC_ALL, ".UTF-8")` + `_snprintf_l` → `n=17` and correct UTF-8. Fixed with
  `_vsnprintf_l` + a private `_create_locale(LC_CTYPE, ".UTF-8")` — **never `setlocale`**, since we are
  injected and LC_CTYPE is shared CRT state the game reads — plus a floor that logs the format string
  when args fail. **Both halves of that call were wrong on the first try and both were caught by audit,
  same day:** `LC_ALL` drags `LC_NUMERIC`, so every `%f` in the log became `1,50` on a ru-RU machine
  (301 call sites, and mp.py parses those numbers); and the `_s` variant `__fastfail`s on a malformed
  specifier, PAST SEH — see the two rows in section 8. *Look FIRST:* when a log-driven verdict says a
  subsystem did nothing, prove the LINE can be written before believing it; a negative log grep is
  evidence only if a positive was possible.
  `memory/lesson_a_log_line_can_vanish_because_of_its_arguments.md`

- **Search prior art by the PROBLEM, not by the mechanism you assumed — and a grep whose hits you don't
  open did not happen.** Asked to ship fonts *"as MTA does"*, I grepped MTA for `download|transfer|
  resource|http`, found `CResourceFileDownloadManager`, and put it to the user as **"the MTA option"** in
  a decision fork. MTA does not ship fonts that way at all: `CEGUIFont.cpp:753/:827` rasterises glyphs
  **on demand** on every `getTextExtent`/`drawText`, with page granularity (`:1489`), a substitute-font
  fallback (`:1519`), an LRU stamp (`:1505`) and pages that are genuinely freed (`:1595`); and
  `CGraphics.cpp:1488/:1549` hands the font FILE to Windows (`AddFontResourceEx(path, FR_PRIVATE, 0)` +
  `D3DXCreateFont(..., DEFAULT_CHARSET, ...)`). Both mean *the OS owns glyph supply*; the downloader
  carries `RESOURCE_FILE_TYPE_MAP/SCRIPT/CLIENT_FILE`. **The aggravating detail: the correct grep ran in
  the same message and returned `CGraphics.cpp` + `CLuaGUIDefs.cpp` — I followed the download hits and
  never opened the font hits.** A successful search for the thing you expected feels exactly like
  confirmation; nothing errors, nothing comes back empty. The standing MTA rule was satisfied in letter
  (I grepped, I cited real files) and broken in spirit. *Look FIRST:* key the search on the problem noun
  ("how does MTA get a glyph on screen"), open the file that does YOUR job before citing the precedent
  in a fork you hand someone else, and treat an un-opened hit as a search that did not happen. Checking
  properly also **retired an arc-D2 objection** — "a cache that never shrinks" — because MTA's shrinks.
  `memory/lesson_search_prior_art_by_problem_not_by_assumed_mechanism.md`

- **An assertion you have never watched go RED is decoration, not evidence.** `mp.py`'s `_i18n_checks`
  carries five fail-closed checks and has **no injection harness anywhere** — every one has only ever run
  against a HEAD where both defects it was written for were already fixed. Two of them are worse than
  unproven, they **cannot fire**: `_EMPTY_LINE` hunts a blank-bodied log line that `log.cpp:189`'s
  `[args unformattable]` fallback made impossible, and `_read_log_strict`'s docstring still claims it
  catches a mid-sequence cut that `log.cpp:192-209` now repairs before writing. Neither could ever have
  caught the defect that motivated the instrument (`'?'` is well-formed ASCII; a blanked name is an
  absence). `nick_gate.ps1` had been injection-proven two days earlier by the same hand — the discipline
  existed and was not carried across. *Look FIRST:* write the must-FAIL fixture in the SAME commit as the
  check; when you fix a product defect, grep for the assertions that were watching for it, because a fix
  can silently retire its own detector; and remember fixtures prove the CHECKER while only a
  defect-carrying build proves the PIPELINE — so land a detector on a live defect and watch it fail
  BEFORE fixing, since live defects are the only free positive controls you will get.
  **THIRD FAMILY MEMBER (2026-07-30): an instrument whose ABSENCE is indistinguishable from its
  SUCCESS.** `tools/mp.py:1539` asserts the font selftest by *negative* grep (`("selftest: FAIL",)`),
  which is sound only while the selftest runs unconditionally at boot; the ImGui flip makes it fire on
  an `atlas->TexData->UniqueID` edge, and at that moment "passed" and "never ran" are the identical
  log. The same file already carries the right shape 700 lines earlier — `mp.py:848` asserts the
  POSITIVE line `"config-selftest: DONE fail=0"`. The negative form is not wrong when written; it rots
  the instant the instrument becomes conditional, and nothing in the diff that makes it conditional
  touches the assertion. *Look FIRST:* assert a positive success line carrying its counts, and when a
  change makes an instrument conditional, grep for who asserts on it.
  **FIXED 2026-07-30 (`0d84cc5a`), in the shape this row recommends:** the selftest emits
  `font selftest: DONE fail=0 (8/8) -- ...` and `tools/mp.py` asserts that line's PRESENCE. Its
  must-FAIL control ran against fixtures (a log with the line passes, one without goes RED) — which is
  FIXTURE-level plus green live runs, **not** a defect-carrying build, and it executes only under
  `--assert-i18n` (`smoke_i18n` / `smoke4`), not the default `smoke`.
  **CLOSED 2026-07-30, and the closing is its own lesson: the sentence above NAMED the hole and the
  hole shipped anyway.** A defect-carrying build (font selftest mutated to fail 2 of 12 rows) was
  smoked, and the default `smoke` printed **PASS** with `fail=2` and two `[ERROR]` rows in both peer
  logs. The assertion now runs from `cmd_smoke` too, over both peer logs, and the same mutant then
  failed with all four findings. *Look FIRST:* a documented gap is not a mitigated one — when a
  sweep writes "…but only under X", that clause is a WORK ITEM, not a caveat, and the next reader
  will treat it as coverage.
  `memory/lesson_an_instrument_never_shown_failing_passes_by_construction.md`

- **A check's NAME decides where it gets called, so a scenario-shaped name is a coverage decision
  (2026-07-30, `tools/mp.py`).** Four assertions — strict UTF-8, no line formatting to nothing, no
  `selftest: FAIL`, and the positive `font selftest: DONE fail=0` — were correct, complete, and
  called from exactly **one** scenario, because the function was named `_i18n_checks`. Nothing in the
  body is about mixed scripts. A build with two deliberately-failing selftest rows and `fail=2` in
  BOTH peer logs printed `PASS` from the plain smoke; renamed `_peer_log_health` and called from
  `cmd_smoke`, the same run failed with all four findings. This is the family's fourth dimension and
  the strangest: the detector had **no defect** — every earlier instance was a check that missed
  something, this one was simply never asked. The name answers "when do I call this?" before anyone
  reads the body, and answers it wrongly and confidently; a scenario-named helper is *born* accurate
  and rots in the same commit that generalises its body. *Look FIRST:* name a check after the
  PROPERTY it asserts, never the scenario that motivated it; when a doc says "the tool asserts X",
  write WHERE; grep a new assertion's own call sites and treat "one call site for a general property"
  as the tell; and read "my mutant passed" as a finding about the HARNESS, never as a reason to
  strengthen the mutant. `memory/lesson_a_checks_name_decides_its_blast_radius.md`

- **A standard's equivalence is not your renderer's equivalence — measure the pixels, not the
  spec (2026-07-30, commit 2 of the ImGui flip).** A 22-round design specified 814 NFC
  composition pairs + canonical combining classes on the fold key, justified by one sentence:
  *"`A`+U+0301 is pixel-indistinguishable from `Á`"*. That is a claim about rendering, and it was
  never rendered. Measured through FreeType with no shaping — what ImGui actually does,
  `FT_DISABLE_HARFBUZZ` is on — the pair matches its precomposed form in **1 of ~3,560 face-pair
  combinations**, because without a GPOS anchor the mark sits at its own left-side bearing. The
  machinery would have collided things that do not look alike to prevent a collision that does
  not occur. Two more inversions in the same hour: 844 was the RAW decomposition count (30 are
  `Composition_Exclusion`, so 814 compose; "41/296 marks" are really 35/302 — nobody had run
  `normalize()`); and rasterising the WHOLE fold set found **476 pixel-identical pairs, only 23
  canonical** — the real collisions are homoglyphs Unicode has no equivalence for **The arc that followed was BUILT and then DECLINED by the user (2026-07-30): mixed-script lookalike names are wanted, not a defect. The measurement stands; do not re-open it as a bug.**
 
  (`A`≡`Α`≡`А`, `C`≡`С`, `3`≡`З`), already shipping. Note the near-miss: after NFC died, "just
  fold the 31 canonical singletons" was proposed AND approved, and it closes 23 of 476 — a site
  list inside the real invariant that survives review precisely because it is standard-derived.
  *Look FIRST:* when a justification is a sentence about what the user SEES, render it (20 lines
  of PIL) before building the table; measure through YOUR pipeline's config, not the library's
  defaults — with HarfBuzz on, the same design would have been right; census the whole space
  (hash every glyph bitmap, group by hash) before folding a subset of it; and before building on
  NFC/NFKC/confusables/collation, state which property of YOUR system it proxies and check the
  proxy holds. `memory/lesson_a_standards_equivalence_is_not_your_renderers.md`

- **A negative control proves the POLICY is right — not that anything APPLIES it (2026-07-30,
  `ui/atlas_watch.cpp`, the §7.4 probes).** Three probes were specified to catch "a missed
  `GlyphExcludeRanges` on a *specific* config". Written exactly as specified —
  `IsGlyphInFont(cp) && InExcludeSet(cp)`, cmap-pure — they are correct, they go RED under mutation,
  and **they cannot catch that failure**: `InExcludeSet` reads our table, so it answers "does the
  policy forbid this codepoint", never "did this `ImFontConfig` receive the policy". Measured: under
  `dev.atlas_no_exclude_drill` (field removed from every config, table untouched) all three stayed
  green (`fail=1`, not `fail=4`). The failure needed a fourth check — a per-source census over
  `atlas->Sources` comparing each config's list by CONTENT — which fired **4 seconds before** the
  superset invariant that was supposed to be the backstop, because the invariant must wait for
  something to be DRAWN and "a config nobody's text exercises" never triggers it. Two shape traps
  came with it: ImGui `ImMemdup`s the list (`imgui_draw.cpp:3116`) so pointer identity is false by
  construction, and comparing against the accessor rather than the generated table would pass
  `NULL == NULL` under the very drill it detects. Survived a 22-round `/qf` because a specified
  *mechanism* stops attracting the question "does that mechanism observe the stated failure?".
  *Look FIRST:* for every check say which of the two it asserts — THE RULE IS RIGHT vs THE RULE IS
  APPLIED HERE — and test a policy check by removing the WIRING, not by corrupting the TABLE.
  `memory/lesson_a_negative_control_proves_the_policy_not_the_wiring.md`

- **One name covering TWO quantities reads as a coherent design and is not — FIVE times in one pass,
  caught by the critic every time and by the primary never (2026-07-29, chat-history `/qf` pass 2).**
  `seq` (local entry identity vs the host's wire order), `alpha` (the store's TTL curve vs the drawn
  composition), `eviction` (live→retained vs retained→gone), "the build gate" (a pinned ImGui frame vs
  a 60 Hz republish), `slot` (display identity vs world-entity handle). The `alpha` one would have
  shipped a feature that **never drew at all** — a retained row's store alpha is 0 by definition and
  the layout predicate `alpha >= threshold` read it. A conflation does not read like an error, it
  reads like concision: every sentence is true of *one* referent, so proof-reading passes, and the
  contradiction only shows when two sentences are held side by side — which a self-written brief
  cannot do. *Look FIRST:* grep your own draft for its load-bearing nouns and count referents before
  the brief goes out; **suspect any word that spans a LAYER BOUNDARY** (all five did: store↔render,
  local↔wire, store↔viewport, identity↔world, design↔measurement); and treat a name introduced *by a
  fix* as the next suspect — three of the five arrived attached to corrections, which is when a design
  is least suspected. As a critic, "which of the two does X read?" costs nothing and found five real
  defects in one pass. `memory/lesson_one_name_for_two_quantities.md`

- **A reframe silently invalidates every earlier answer that CITED what it changed — twice in one
  pass, despite the `/qf` skill already carrying a RE-AUDIT instruction for exactly this
  (2026-07-29).** (a) Round 1 proved "the seed strictly precedes every live line, so no dedup is
  needed"; round 2 then put `ChatLine` into `IsPreWorldSendableKind` to close a principle-8 hole and
  destroyed that premise — un-re-derived until round 11, by which point pre-world rows sorted NEWER
  than the seed **and** `lineSeq > highestApplied` would have discarded the ENTIRE seed with no error
  anywhere. (b) Round 2 WITHDREW "the host composes the name once" because under host-**relay**
  (`session_relay.cpp:95-99` copies verbatim) the host provably could not; the design later became
  host-**authored** and the withdrawal rode forward un-re-tested until round 13, leaving two peers
  with **permanently different names for one message**. *Look FIRST:* when you change a GATE, LANE,
  AUTHORITY or THREAD, grep your own prior answers for the thing you changed **by name, not by
  memory**; keep **withdrawals** on the same re-test list as claims ("was that rejected on a ground
  that still holds?"); and know that **a fix which closes a hole is the highest-risk reframe**,
  because it does not feel like a premise change.
  **SECOND SHAPE 2026-08-25, and it is the worse one: the reframe was a FOUNDATIONAL constraint and
  the casualty sat in ANOTHER DOC, THREE MONTHS EARLIER.** `MULTIPLAYER_UI.md`'s approach table
  (2026-05-22) rejected the BPModLoader widget route for exactly one stated reason -- *"ties us to
  UE4SS"*. On 2026-08-21 the F2/D-3 decision made Multivoid a UE4SS mod **on purpose**, and
  `BPModLoaderMod` has been installed in the profile ever since; the row still read as a live verdict
  until the user asked, on 2026-08-25, for the very feature it had deferred. Its neighbour deferred
  the sibling-pak path *"until a public-server-phase widget (server browser with sortable rows)
  actually needs it"* -- both halves of that trigger came true and nothing noticed. Why this shape is
  nastier: the reframe and the casualty are in **different files**, so re-reading either proves
  nothing and the in-pass `/qf` re-derivation habit cannot reach it; the casualty is phrased as a
  settled **VERDICT**, which is the last place anyone looks for rot; and a foundational reframe has an
  unlisted blast radius by definition -- RULE 3 was cited tree-wide as the reason for many small
  choices, and D-3's ledger tracked only the ones inside its own arc. *Look FIRST:* when a
  FOUNDATIONAL constraint is reversed, do not just update the doc that owns the decision -- **grep the
  whole tree for the constraint's own wording** (`ties us to`, `depends on`, `without X`, the rule
  number) and re-read every verdict citing it, **rejected and deferred rows included**. Deferred rows
  get their own grep: they carry a *trigger condition*, and a trigger condition is a claim about the
  future that can quietly come true.
  `memory/lesson_a_reframe_invalidates_answers_that_cite_it.md`

- **A reclassification that leaves the OBSERVABLE unchanged is a relabel, not a dissolution
  (2026-07-29).** A row vanishing at full opacity when the reveal block hit its height budget was
  "dissolved" by reclassifying it from a store exit to a **viewport** event and using
  `ImDrawList::PushClipRect` (real: `imgui.h:3071`) so the oldest row would "slide up and out". It had
  every signature of a good dissolution — simpler mechanism, deleted state, a real in-tree primitive.
  One round later: **`hud.cpp:369` recomputes `y = anchorBottomY - totalH` every frame**, so a new
  line jumps the block one `rowH` in ONE frame. Nothing slides; the clip turned an instant vanish into
  an instant clip. The true answer was that smooth motion needs cross-frame state AND was out of scope
  (Minecraft, the user's own reference, does not animate chat scroll). *Look FIRST:* after any
  reclassification, **state the observable before and after in one sentence each — if they are the
  same sentence, you relabelled the defect**; and grep for the motion verb (*slides/eases/scrolls*)
  and confirm something actually interpolates the position, because a per-frame recomputation from
  current state cannot animate. `memory/lesson_a_reclassification_is_not_a_dissolution.md`
- **Re-anchor on the ORIGINATING ask, not the thread you are currently in (USER CORRECTION
  2026-07-29).** The user, mid-build: *"We started the chat saga when I wanted it to support glyphs,
  remember?"* The arc was glyphs → "glyphs in chat too" → a look at chat → "there's no history" → chat
  history, and that last branch consumed **five `/qf` passes, 75 rounds** (21+17+4+14+19), two full
  architectures and a build — while the ORIGINATING request had a free, measured, **explicitly ungated**
  deliverable sitting in its own NEXT list (`+LatExt+Greek`: zero bytes, +7 ms, +1,787 glyphs). It
  shipped in one commit in twenty minutes once actually looked at. **`/qf`'s ANSWERS-THE-ACTUAL-ASK
  angle did not catch this and structurally cannot**: it holds the design against the CURRENT thread's
  ask, and every round was well-aimed at chat history. Nothing ever asks *"what was the request that
  spawned THIS request?"* A sub-thread inherits full legitimacy from its parent and then competes with
  it for the entire budget, and because each round is individually correct the drift is invisible from
  inside. **Look FIRST: when a request spawns a sub-request, write down the parent and treat its NEXT
  list as LIVE WORK — read it before opening another design pass, and prefer an ungated+measured+small
  item over an interrogated+large one. Depth on a sub-thread is not progress on the parent.**
  `memory/feedback_reanchor_on_the_originating_ask_not_the_current_thread.md`
- **Five objections that share one root are ONE objection and a list.** A design was carried forward for
  two sessions as *"DEAD on five counts, three of them measured"*. Taken apart (2026-07-30): count 4 was
  **false** against the very prior art it cited (MTA hands a FILE to the OS via `AddFontResourceEx` +
  `D3DXCreateFont`; `MapCharacters` is a discovery API MTA never touches), count 2 was a **product
  question**, count 1 a **survivable cost**, count 6 an **invariant to preserve** — and count 3, the only
  real kill, was a **CONSEQUENCE** of the missing dynamic atlas, not an independent fact. A numbered list
  reads as cumulative evidence and nothing in its shape prompts you to ask whether the items are
  independent. *Look FIRST:* classify each count (kill / cost / constraint / product question / false)
  before counting it; then ask of every surviving kill *"cause or consequence?"* — **if prior art runs the
  same mechanism safely at scale, the difference between them and you IS the root.**
  `memory/lesson_several_objections_may_share_one_root.md`
- **Decompose a rejected mechanism into AXES before telling the user their choice is dead.** The user chose
  *«lets not ship them in dll, lets ship them as mta does»* — OS fonts, on demand. A later `/qf` killed
  "on demand" and the verdict was carried as *the user's mechanism is dead*. It contains **two orthogonal
  axes**: SOURCING (DLL donor vs the player's fonts — what the user actually chose) and TRIGGERING (eager
  vs on-first-sight — the only axis the objection touched). Six rounds argued mechanism against a decision
  already made, while the half the user cared about went unexamined. *Look FIRST:* write the chosen
  mechanism as a conjunction of axes, attach every objection to ONE named axis, and report per axis
  ("the sourcing half stands; the triggering half fails, because…") — never "your mechanism is dead". If
  the surviving axes still don't solve it, say so **with the reason it is mechanism-independent**.
  `memory/feedback_decompose_a_rejected_mechanism_into_axes.md`
- **A cost number must carry its REGIME, or it will be quoted in the wrong one.** Three fusions in ONE
  `/qf` pass, each after conceding the previous: eager-bake numbers quoted as the price of *demand* bake
  (demand ships **zero** DLL bytes — the trade is not freeze SIZE but **who holds the lever**, local-rare
  vs remote-unbounded); an in-game 58-80 ms measurement glued to an offline 173 ms probe cell as one
  "58-173 ms" range; and a LEGAL price (`+FULL CJK`, 4096x16384) fused with an ILLEGAL one (`EVERYTHING`
  @worst@x2.0, 4096x32768 — no font texture at all), which reads as "there is no YES branch" when there
  is. The mechanism: regimes live in the surrounding prose while numbers travel alone. *Look FIRST:* put
  the regime **in the label** (`+FULL CJK eager @default x1.0: 64 MB / 810 ms`); never merge an in-game
  number with a probe number into one interval; re-derive from the source table, never from your own
  previous summary. `memory/lesson_a_cost_number_must_carry_its_regime.md`

- **Answer a short proposal's SCOPE, not its widest reading -- a well-evidenced rebuttal of the version
  they did not propose can kill a correct idea.** 2026-08-25: the user asked **"А может графы тоже
  сделаем?"** (four words). I answered the maximal reading -- author the browser's logic in Blueprint
  graphs -- measured the MTA precedent, listed four costs and recommended against it. Their next
  message: **"Я про графы для биндинга делегатов"** -- a Blueprint purely to OWN a UFunction so a
  delegate has a target. Narrow, precise, and RIGHT: it dissolved a premise this codebase had polled
  around for months, and the final shape needed no Blueprint at all. Note the failure mode is not the
  wasted message -- it is that **"you would click every node" and "debugging a graph in a cooked pak is
  painful" are true of the wide version and irrelevant to a 3-node sink**, so a deferring user would
  have dropped a good idea to objections it never earned; confidence transfers across scopes. LOOK
  FIRST: when a short proposal touches a settled decision, **ask which scope** (one line; this is asking
  what was SAID, not which option to take, so it does not conflict with
  `feedback_no_crutch_questions_act_autonomously`) -- or failing that, **answer the NARROWEST useful
  reading first** and offer the wide one in a sentence. Watch the word **"тоже"/"also"**: it scopes an
  ADDITION to what is already agreed, not a replacement. And when a proposal attacks a premise you are
  defending, **take the premise down to the studs before defending the design on top of it**.

- **The answer was already written down in this repo -- TEN times across three passes, and the worst
  three were in MY OWN register, one of them written hours earlier in the same effort** (2026-08-26,
  the A54 design passes). I presented as new: a design decision `docs/COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md` sec4b/sec5 had already
  converged (the per-kind default-deny table, in the file CLAUDE.md's reading order names as required
  BEFORE any authority work); a defect the code already comments in place at BOTH of its call sites; and TWO
  register rows I proposed re-filing that already existed, in the same 729-line register I had been
  editing all session. Common cause: **I searched by the thing I was working ON (the finding ID) rather
  than by the thing I had just FOUND (the mechanism)**. FIRST next time: before filing any new row in a
  register you own, grep it for the MECHANISM (`PropDestroy`, `relay`, the function name), never for the
  row you came from -- a duplicate row splits one open finding in two, and the whole value of that
  register is that one finding is one row. **Rounds 9-12 added three more, each worse than the last:** I proposed
  deleting the producer-side pose gate whose purpose I had myself written down the day before
  (`memory/lesson_the_producer_may_already_suppress_the_phenomenon.md`, about that exact line); I
  designed a per-kind authority split without opening `docs/COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md` sec2b, which already
  names that bucket and names act-as-host as the model it "should be promoted to";
  and I re-derived, over four rounds, a relay-vs-thread-ordering fix the tree had **already shipped
  twice** -- `ChatMessage` v133 and `EmailAppend`, whose own comment states my conclusion verbatim
  ("the relay fires on the NET thread at receive time, before the game thread ... so at relay time the
  order does not yet exist") and forbids the variant I had just picked ("keeping both paths would be
  two implementations of one concept compiled together (RULE 2)"). SECOND rule, from those three:
  **when a design question is about AUTHORITY, ordering, or who-may-write, open the reading-order doc
  BEFORE the code** -- three of the six instances point at files CLAUDE.md already told me to read
  first, and a shipped precedent is findable by grepping the whitelist you are about to edit for the
  word NOT. **Pass 2 added three more, and they are the worst of the nine because the source was my
  own writing:** (7) I proposed a root a row in my own register already stated
  verbatim -- the count, the RULE-2 citation, and the pointer to the model it belongs to -- a row I
  had personally re-read and upgraded `[A]`->`[V]` *hours earlier the same day*; (8) I briefed
  a per-payload classification ratchet that **the row's own fix-of-record had already REJECTED on the
  record** ("generating the whole dispatcher from a per-`ReliableKind` row"); (9) the open question I
  spent five rounds on -- what makes the check unskippable -- is answered in that same paragraph
  ("not the classification word ... but the ARGUMENT TYPE: `token.Resolve(eid)` ... skipping it is a
  missing argument, not a missing line"). **Instance 10 (2026-08-26) is a PROCEDURE, not a fact, and it had already been
  EXECUTED once:** mid-way through a pre-push leak audit I reasoned from scratch about whether to rewrite
  the unpushed commits or scrub only the tip -- while the project's own pre-push-audit feedback file
  already said "scrubbing unpushed commits = rebuild", gave the command shape, and recorded the
  second-order cost (a rebuild danglees every SHA already cited in docs/memory -- 9 dangling refs found
  the previous time). It is the strongest prior art there is and the easiest to grep for: I was running a
  ritual the file is NAMED for. THIRD rule: **before designing a fix for a register row,
  read that row's OWN fix-of-record to the end** -- a register whose rows carry a fix section will
  answer the question you are about to spend a pass on. FOURTH rule: **when executing a named ritual --
  a leak audit, a release checklist, a migration runbook -- grep `memory/` for that ritual's NAME before
  the first decision inside it**, not after. **Instance 11 (2026-08-29) is the tightest radius yet: the
  answer was in the FILE BEING EDITED, named at `build-core.yml:88` and executed by both sibling gates,
  and my new step's comment claimed "same family as those gates" while omitting their `$LASTEXITCODE`
  check** -- so the drill's failure exit was discarded by pwsh's last-command rule and the must-fire
  control could never fail CI (caught by the post-ship audit, fixed as one combined invocation,
  `27291108`). FIFTH rule: **"same family/shape as X" in a comment is a CHECKLIST, not a description --
  diff your step against X's actual body before writing the claim.** **Instance 12 (2026-08-29): the
  answer was the FIRST LINE of every sibling** -- two brand-new PE interceptors violated the thread
  contract written at `game_thread.h:166-170` + `COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md:68-71` and followed by
  ~40 existing interceptor bodies (the `IsGameThread()` gate / atomic-only reads); the standing
  post-ship audit caught it as its one CRITICAL (`36e74269`). SIXTH rule: **before writing a new
  callback for an existing hook type, read two existing callbacks of that type and copy their
  opening gate before the body.**
  `memory/lesson_the_answer_was_already_written_down_in_this_repo.md`

  **INSTANCE 13 (2026-08-29) -- a TASK SPEC whose options were already RANKED, and I shipped the one
  it rejected.** The user re-asked for "one shared `scientists.pak`"; I measured the break from scratch
  and shipped a hardcoded bundle->members map. `docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` section 7.7b had SPECIFIED that task
  six days earlier, measured the same break in the same words, ranked three options and rejected the
  hardcoded list *"unless (i)/(ii) both fail"* -- neither was tried. And a row in THIS file, written the
  same day, had already counted **eleven** surfaces pinned to one-pak-per-skin and warned that "fixing
  the logic alone ships a build whose own UI lies"; my commit fixed the 3 logic sites and left the 2
  player-facing strings and 6 contract comments lying, exactly as predicted. Both were found by the
  `/documentize` grep, after shipping. SEVENTH rule: **a user RE-ASKING for something is not evidence
  that nothing is written about it** -- it is often evidence it was specified once and never built, so
  grep the doc tree for the ARTIFACT's name before designing.
- **Classify by the predicate you are ENFORCING, not by a property of the wire** (2026-08-26, two `/qf` passes on one
  register row). The row asks a question about **what a HANDLER does with `senderSlot`**. I sized it
  seven times by WIRE properties instead and produced seven wrong sets: 11 lanes (assembled, never
  enumerated) -> 36 payload structs (corrected then to "45 structs / 69 fields, 16 multi-subject" --
  **and that correction was itself falsified 2026-08-26: `[V]` 40 / 53 / ~5, because the census counted
  by field TYPE and `WireKey` carries asset names as well as identities**) -> 17
  by a two-property intersection -> "17 is the set" (falsified by one case I had already measured) ->
  "so strike that case" (backwards, for a reason the wire property could not see) -> 48 handlers
  (contaminated: `[V]` 52 exact `if (sender{,Peer}Slot ==/!= 0)` are ROLE tests, so 48 is a LOWER
  bound). The HANDLER-side question -- *does the sender influence a refusal, or only a log?* -- was
  one grep and right the first time: `[V]` 102 sender-taking handlers, ~10 genuine authority checks,
  each bespoke. That measurement **corrected the row's own headline** (nothing owned the
  question -> ten places did, and they disagreed). FIRST next time: **write the predicate as a sentence about a function
  before counting anything**, then **run the classifier against one case whose answer you already
  know** -- my first sender-gate scan globbed only `src/**`, missed every send living in a header, and
  reported the one case I had just measured as its opposite. Wire properties feel like measurement
  because they are enumerable; cheapness reads as rigour when the output is a table.
  `memory/lesson_classify_by_the_predicate_you_enforce_not_by_the_wire.md`

- **A constraint on one path is theatre while a second path reaches the same state** (2026-08-26).
  This tree has lanes where a peer can EITHER send an INTENT the host arbitrates OR send the resulting
  STATE directly, and the two are validated by different code that agrees about nothing. Adding a term
  to the intent path then constrains **only the well-behaved caller** -- the other path is unchanged
  and still arrives. `[V]` **Promotion to host-authoritative does not retire the twin by itself**: the
  tree's showcase `Channel::Mode::HostAuth` lane still has its state kind on the relay whitelist and an
  authorization hook that takes no sender, so the promotion suppressed the honest PRODUCER and left the
  receive side exactly as it was. The two things that actually matter are separate and must both be
  checked: **is the STATE kind still relayable, and does the authorization hook take the sender at
  all?** `ChatMessage` v133 and `EmailAppend` did the first (out of the whitelist, RULE 2, one
  implementation); the promoted lane did neither, which is why it is **not** precedent for one.
  FIRST next time: **before adding a term to an intent path, grep the relay whitelist for the STATE
  kind that intent produces** -- if it is there and validated only for length/finiteness/range, the new
  term is cosmetic.

- **A census row is worth exactly what its citation is worth** (2026-08-26, a refuse-vs-LOSS table).
  I traced ONE lane and asserted six; tracing them reversed **two rows in opposite directions** --
  `CoinCollect` had a shipped heal I assumed absent (`coingun_collect.cpp:472-492`, and it is NOT on the
  new refusal path: eight early returns precede the balance read that gates it), and
  `KerfurConvertRequest` had none where I assumed one (`kerfur_convert_host.cpp:262-300`, every deny
  path a bare `return`). **The table format did the laundering** -- prose hedges, a grid cell does not,
  so nine rows read as nine measurements. The same defect had been caught one level up two rounds
  earlier (an untagged LOSS section) and I rebuilt it inside the newly-tagged table. FIRST next time:
  a cell with no `file:line` gets the word `UNTRACED`, not a verdict; and for "does a refusal cost
  anything here" the two things to open are the CLIENT-side producer (is the local action cancelled or
  does it complete?) and every early return above the repair path.
  `memory/lesson_a_census_row_is_worth_its_citation.md`

- **A targeted grep is not a census, and the claim is about the SET** (2026-08-25, the native-browser
  `/qf` — the same error **five times in one session**, four caught by a critic). Whenever the sentence
  is about a set — *all callers*, *the palette*, *N offsets*, *no override*, *exactly two functions* —
  a grep that confirms the thing already suspected got reported as the answer to the wider claim. The
  grep **succeeds**, so there is no error signal. Two shapes, two fixes: **depth** (evidence one
  indirection short — a sibling field `ResourceObject` vs `ResourceName`, a wrapper `LoadCached` vs
  the direct call sites, a subordinate clause *"(and any future ImGui menu surface)"*) → follow one
  more hop; **breadth** (evidence one scope short — six offset names instead of the block's 30, one
  menu's palette instead of both, `switcher_widgets` censused inside `ui_menu` only and shipped as an
  *invariant* while `ui_stats` and `ui_settings` both reach it) → widen by one unit and re-run.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: grep your own SENTENCE before the code — if it holds `all`/`every`/`only`/`no`/
  `exactly`/a count/a plural set-noun, the evidence owed is an **enumeration**, not a hit. An
  invariant censused inside one file is a site list wearing an invariant's clothes (the sibling case
  of the leak-sweep lesson below). And when RETIRING code this compounds: **the renderer being deleted
  encodes correctness its data struct's field names do not** — the version cell was
  `game + " b" + proto`, not `game + version`.
  `memory/lesson_a_targeted_grep_is_not_a_census.md`
- **A signature match is class membership, not attribution — and "exactly N" must be counted over
  the WHOLE population** (2026-08-28/29, the fix-B RED table). The §4b dump census called hash
  `3E0EBD39…` "the double-detour cohort, exactly 7 dumps" and the families "discriminable by error
  string alone"; filing the knob-repro's fresh dump forced a recount, and the hash + error-string
  pair had **5 more members from 2026-05-25/30 — the proxy era, when the claimed mechanism could
  not exist** (no PolyHook in-process). The census had read all 102 dumps; the failure was
  semantics, not scope — "7 in the window my hypothesis is about" was written as "exactly 7",
  and the signature (`#GP` at a non-canonical address → "AV read 0xffff…ffff") is the CLASS of
  "call through a garbage pointer", which many roots produce. A future triager matching a dump's
  hash against the doc would have closed the wrong investigation on it. Attribution rests on the
  timing bracket + the mechanism decode + the on-demand repro (`UE4SS_ARC.md` §4d); the match is
  one leg, never the proof.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: before writing "exactly N" / "unique to X" / "discriminable by Y alone" about
  any signature (crash hash, error string, log line, AOB), run the matcher over the ENTIRE
  population and check the complement — one member outside the predicted window demotes the
  signature from fingerprint to class.
  `memory/lesson_a_signature_match_is_class_membership_not_attribution.md`

- **A `[V]` with no citation deletes its own fact — and a grep for a VALUE cannot hit a STRUCTURED
  dump** (2026-08-25, A54 design pass). `mainPlayer.armLength = 200.0` carried `[V]` in four places
  with a pointer to WHERE in none of them, and it is load-bearing twice: the SHIPPED A52 ledger sizes
  `kUnearnedJumpCm = 50` as "4x under the 200 uu reach". Grepping `research/` found only my own prose,
  so I wrote "traceable to nothing" into a `/qf` brief and a critic made it blocking. **The value was
  measured all along** — the CDO tagged property in `research/pak_re/inv_ui_dump/mainPlayer.json`,
  export `Default__mainPlayer_C`, `{"Name":"armLength","Value":200.0}`. Two mechanical failures: a
  tag earns itself from a citation, not from confidence (without one the failure is inverted — you
  DELETE a true fact); and `armLength = 200` appears in no UAssetAPI JSON because name and number are
  separate keys. Same pass, second instance: "`arm` rays from the CAMERA" was presented to a critic as
  a new finding that broke the design — it was documented **two lines below the claim being grepped**
  and the code comment already corrected in `abc9681b`.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: before writing `[V]`, write WHERE (file + export + key). Before calling a constant
  unmeasured, grep the property NAME (never the value) across `research/pak_re/*.json` and
  `research/bp_reflection/*.json` and walk `Default__<Class>_C` → `Data` → `{"Name","Value"}` in
  Python; `_fn.py <asset> <Function>` / `_cfg.py <asset> <Ubergraph>` answer the different question
  "literal or property?" in seconds. And read the WHOLE paragraph before telling anyone a fact is
  unsourced.
  `memory/lesson_a_v_tag_without_a_citation_deletes_its_own_fact.md`

- **Before asking "what INSTRUMENT would settle this?", ask "does any decision depend on it?" —
  a measurement nobody's decision needs is a shelf with extra steps** (2026-08-25). The user closed
  the hands-on route (*"When im on pc i wont test it either"*), so I wrote a standing rule: never end
  a plan on a hands-on, the design owes an instrument. I then answered my own rule literally and
  designed a movement-calibration harness. A critic killed it on four independent counts: the gap
  distribution it would collect was **already printed unconditionally in every existing smoke log**
  (`dt=[11..24] ms use<=77 bank<=69`); its teleport regime would have measured a schedule *I* wrote;
  a loopback distribution on one box is structurally not the field's, so those constants are
  un-calibratable by **any** autonomous run; and the one genuinely un-derived constant was labelled
  **"THIS IS A POLICY CHOICE, NOT A MEASUREMENT" in its own header** — a product question at zero
  build cost. The user answered it in two words and the measurement problem evaporated, taking two
  successive "blockers" with it.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: the ladder is (a) does a decision depend on this? (b) is the answer already in a
  log or dump I have? (c) is it a POLICY question a human should just answer? (d) only then build an
  instrument. Jumping to (d) is the same shelf the rule was written to prevent, one level up — and a
  constant whose own comment says "policy choice, not a measurement" is (c) by its own admission.
  `memory/feedback_autonomous_evidence_is_the_ceiling.md`

- **A concession is not a measurement, and two opposite concessions are not convergence**
  (2026-08-26, three `/qf` rounds on one design). Asked whether the mechanism I was building could
  fix a particular register row, I answered **no** in round 1, **yes** in round 2 (and wrote a
  second-site fix the row itself had already forbidden), and round 3 falsified that fix from code
  the repo already carried -- the two cases I proposed splitting are fused ON PURPOSE, and I had no
  measurement that the honest case cannot occur. Three rounds, two reversals, **zero measurements
  taken in between**; each reversal was me adopting the last thing said to me. The honest end state
  was "unresolved by this design", which is what shipped and which neither confident answer was.
  Why it is seductive: a critic's question arrives with evidence attached, so conceding FEELS like
  updating on evidence -- but the evidence supports the OBJECTION, not the alternative you invent
  while conceding, which is new, unexamined, and written under social pressure. THE TELL: you are
  writing "you are right" and proposing a replacement in the same breath.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: when a round overturns an answer you gave, the next move is a **measurement, not
  another answer** — name the read that would settle it and take it before writing the replacement.
  If it is unavailable, "unresolved" is a real answer and costs nothing.
  `memory/lesson_a_concession_is_not_a_measurement.md`

- **An instrument existing is not the same as its question being answered** (2026-08-26). A module
  shipped a sampler whose own comment read *"the number that justifies (or refutes) moving X in the
  enforcing build"*. I was designing that exact move and cited **the sentence** as the
  justification. A critic asked what a real log line reads: `[V]` the entire corpus across all four
  installs held **ONE** sample, reading `0`, on a line whose neighbouring fields showed the subject
  had not moved — the one condition where that quantity is zero by construction. The instrument had
  never sampled the case it was built for, because no autonomous scenario produced that case. It
  slipped through because the comment is TRUE and well written: it is phrased in the vocabulary of a
  measurement and sits at the line the code lives, so the gap between "we built the thing that would
  tell us" and "it told us" is invisible at the call site. Second-order: a fixed-schedule sampler
  only sees what the world happens to be doing at that instant — sampling at the **decision site**,
  once per real event, collects the distribution that matters and costs nothing on a quiet run.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: when a comment says an instrument answers a question you are about to build on,
  **grep the logs for its output first**, and check neighbouring fields to confirm the sample was
  taken where the quantity is meaningful. `n=1` under degenerate conditions is not evidence.
  `memory/lesson_an_instrument_comment_is_not_its_output.md`

- **A field TYPE is not its ROLE — run the census both ways, the disagreement IS the finding**
  (2026-08-26). Counting how many wire payloads name a SUBJECT by matching on field TYPE
  over-counted: one shared serialisable key type carries entity identities AND asset names, so
  `[V]` a `WireKey` member named `propName` (a content-table row name) scored as a subject. The
  mirror method failed too — a NAME-based pattern missed two `WireKey` members named unlike
  anything I searched for. Two further errors pointed opposite ways: several payloads deliberately
  carry BOTH a key and an element id for the SAME artifact (one artifact, two spellings, receiver
  falls back), which made each look multi-subject. Correcting all of it took a **carried figure of
  16** multi-subject structs down to about **5**, several outside the relevant population. This is
  structural, not careless: a codebase evolves toward one wire primitive carrying identities, asset
  names, rows and labels, because they all serialise alike.
  LOOK HERE FIRST: run the census **by type AND by name**, treat the disagreement as the finding
  rather than noise, then open the declarations they disagree about and read the COMMENT beside each
  field — that is where the role is written. Never re-quote a carried count without re-deriving it;
  when publishing one, say which method produced it.
  `memory/lesson_a_fields_type_is_not_its_role.md`

- **Two agents, one machine resource: the lost run is cheap, the FALSE ATTRIBUTION is not**
  (2026-08-26). Two Claude sessions on the same box destroyed several of each other's game runs --
  every `mp.py` scenario begins by killing EVERY VotV process. The expensive part was that the
  survivor reports `FAIL: expected 2 peers at end, got 1`, which is **indistinguishable from a real
  defect in whatever was just changed**: both sessions debugged their own code, and one sent a
  confident "your build is a boot-killer" message that took an mtime census across every modified
  file to retract. Two pieces of that evidence were reasonable and both were wrong — *"zero lines
  from your subsystem"* did not discriminate (the process died far upstream of where that subsystem
  initialises, so its silence was consistent with ANY cause), and *"your build was on disk"* was
  backwards because **whoever ran `deploy-all` last owns the DLL** and neither had run `md5sum`.
  Third hazard, quieter: a shared file held BOTH sessions' uncommitted work, so one `git add` would
  have swept the other's away. FIXED as a lock enforced at `mp.py`'s dispatch point
  (`tools/game_lock.py`, `docs/CROSS_SESSION.md`) rather than a courtesy, because a protocol that
  must be REMEMBERED gets forgotten under time pressure — the same shape as the argument-type
  ratchet. The lock's own non-obvious part: staleness is NOT uniform — a scenario's lock is stale on
  a dead PID, but a launcher that starts a game and EXITS ON PURPOSE has a dead PID by design, and
  judging both alike handed a held lock straight to the second session (caught by a drill, not by
  review).
  LOOK HERE FIRST: when two agents share a machine resource, identify its DESTRUCTIVE operation and
  assume a concurrent run's failure message will lie about the cause. Before debugging a failure
  during shared work: check whether anyone else ran, `md5sum` the artifact you think you measured,
  and `git diff` any shared file before staging — stage your own hunks with `git apply --cached`
  after a `--check` dry run.
  `memory/lesson_two_agents_one_machine_resource.md`

- **A doc that SPECIFIES reads, months later, as a doc that RECORDS — and the tell is grammatical.**
  2026-08-26: in ONE session I cited this project's own plan-of-record as if it were the tree **four
  times** — a census that asked for the payload's name instead of the retiring proxy's; "no acceptance
  definition exists" while `THUNDERSTORE.md:237` held a 9-item pre-flight; `UE4SS_ARC:667` citing
  "tripwire wire-e" as live while `VERSION_MIGRATION:473` says wire-d/wire-e "remain OWED"; and worst,
  quoting **DebugMod's** `manifest.json` as *"our manifest"* when `git ls-files` finds none at all.
  A living doc holds two moods in one voice — *"`publish.ps1` MUST fail closed"* (a spec) and
  *"wire-e"* (a proper noun, which is how we name things that exist) — and both read as indicative
  later. Status tables do not save you: the tag sits in a section header while the load-bearing
  citation sits 600 lines away in another file.
  **LOOK FIRST:** before leaning on a named mechanism, grep for it in the TREE, not the docs — a
  doc-to-doc citation chain is not evidence. Read the sentence's MOOD ("must/should/will" = a plan).
  When WRITING, tag it at the point of citation ("wire-e (**OWED**)") — six characters kill the class.
  A quoted artifact owes its owner's name in the same breath.
  `memory/lesson_a_doc_that_specifies_reads_as_a_doc_that_records.md`

- **2026-08-26 -- A CENSUS IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS KEY, and one session picked the wrong key FIVE
  times.** All the same mistake with five faces: grepped the PAYLOAD's name not the PROXY's (missed a
  hard `throw` that blocks every release mid-arc); used `git log -S"sym"` as evidence of no callers
  (it measures whether that STRING was ever written, a different question); stopped the census at
  `src/` and missed `tools/mp.py` pinning a log literal -- in an instrument committed HOURS earlier;
  grepped PROSE ("remove", "uninitialize") instead of CALLS (`MH_RemoveHook(`) and so missed a third
  call in the very file being rewritten; and grouped identifiers by NAME (`g_orig*`) instead of by
  ASSIGNMENT SITE, where 4 of 15 were not trampolines at all and renaming them would have authored the
  INVERSE of the lie being fixed. Every one was caught by a critic, never by me. LOOK FIRST: name the
  OPERATION and grep THAT -- if your pattern is a word from your own sentence, it is the wrong key;
  write the AFTER sentence and grep what it falsifies across `src/` + `tools/` + `docs/`, all three;
  and treat a suspiciously tidy census as a warning, not a result.
  **TWO MORE 2026-08-26, and the second is the worst kind.** (6) I keyed a retire-census on the file
  EXTENSION `multivoid-*.dll` instead of the name STEM `multivoid-*`, missing 4 sites on
  `multivoid-*.map` -- `[V]` including `tools/maprva.py:11`, whose `max(glob(...))` **raises on an
  empty glob**, so the crash symbolizer would have died the moment the DLL was renamed. (7) I keyed
  the trampoline rename on the NAME `g_orig*` instead of the ASSIGNMENT SITE, missing
  `save_block.cpp`'s `g_original` -- the **twelfth of twelve** `hook::Install` out-params, whose own
  comment already said "Trampoline" -- **while the commit message asserted "censused BY ASSIGNMENT
  SITE"**. That commit was fixing a four-month-old bug whose entire cause was an auditor reading a
  variable's NAME. *Look FIRST:* knowing the rule and asserting you followed it are both compatible
  with not having followed it; the only thing that is not is **producing the enumeration**. If a claim
  says "censused by X", the message should carry the OUTPUT of X --
  `grep -rn "hook::Install(" -A2 | grep -oE "&g_[A-Za-z_]+"` is twelve lines you either have or do not.
  **AN EIGHTH, 2026-08-30, and it answered a SECURITY question wrong.** An external reviewer asked
  *"can I run a server without sending my IP to the master server?"*. I censused over the NAME of a
  helper (`http::Post`/`http::Get`) and got the tidy answer "seven endpoints, exhaustively" -- `[V]`
  missing two whole classes, because the key was *what learns my IP*, not *what calls our HTTP
  function*: `signaling_client.cpp:298` opens a RAW socket and `ice_config.cpp:50-61` hands GNS a
  STUN list plus our own coturn credentials. FOUR classes, not one. The gate that now holds the fix
  is built around the operations for exactly this reason -- a gate grepping `http::` would have
  reproduced the blind spot and felt like coverage (`tools/net/master_contact_gate.py`).

- **`docs/CREDITS.md` (was `FIELD_REPORTS.md`) records OTHER people's input, never the maintainer's own.** USER RULE
  2026-08-29, verbatim: *"you don't need to fill the field reports which are from me (pelmentor),
  that thing is more for other testers, other people."* The file is a public credit-and-record
  ledger -- its value is social as much as technical, and it is the source for the README and
  website tester tables. Padding it with the maintainer's own debugging both dilutes the tester
  list and misattributes where a finding came from. Applied the same day: a 165-line section on
  "all peers can't move forward" -- reported by the user mid-test, not by a tester -- was written
  into it and then removed. LOOK FIRST: ask *whose report is this?* If the answer is "mine", it is
  not a field report; it belongs in `docs/LESSONS.md` + a `memory/` file, the relevant living doc,
  and the backlog. **SHARPENED 2026-08-30**, when contributors and testers merged into one ledger
  (`docs/CREDITS.md`, three kinds: `code` / `report` / `review`): the rule binds the **report** and
  **review** kinds ONLY. The `code` rows legitimately carry the maintainer and Claude -- an
  authorship list is not a report list -- so "no maintainer rows in that file" is the wrong reading
  of it, and deleting them would be a regression, not an application of the rule.
  `memory/feedback-field-reports-are-for-other-people.md`

- **2026-08-30 -- when the pass condition is "nothing changed", the SUBJECT cannot witness it.** The browser's order verdict passed on SILENCE from a detector that logs only on failure -- and silence is equally what a client that never re-fetched produces. `measured` a correctly-sorted re-sync is BYTE-IDENTICAL to no re-sync, which is the definition of the fix working, so no log line the subject could emit distinguishes the two. The witness must be whatever DEMANDED the change: the fixture reports whether its shuffle moved anything and counts what it served, and both are now required before silence reads as a pass. **Look here FIRST:** three tells -- the pass branch is `not find(<failure line>)` and nothing else; the property is a NEGATIVE; and you cannot name the line that would have appeared had the test actually run. The fix is never "make the subject louder". Show the guard RED by disabling the receipt. [[lesson-when-the-pass-is-nothing-changed-the-subject-cannot-witness-it]]

- **2026-08-30 -- a keep-alive client monopolises a single-threaded test server, and the symptom is a TIMEOUT, not an error.** `measured` `tools/fake_master.py`'s `/control/count|shuffle|state` had NEVER answered while a game was attached: `protocol_version = "HTTP/1.1"` turns on keep-alive and `HTTPServer` serves one connection at a time, so `serve_forever` parked on the game's socket. The mutation endpoints written for harness phases C/D/E were unreachable in exactly the scenario they exist for -- and the docstring's `curl` example only ever worked with no client connected. `ThreadingHTTPServer` fixed it; the read path already held the state lock. **Look here FIRST:** any fixture serving the system under test AND the harness is a two-client server, and `http.server`'s default is one; check `protocol_version` and the server class together. A control that TIMES OUT rather than 404s means suspect OCCUPANCY before existence. [[lesson-a-keep-alive-client-monopolises-a-single-threaded-test-server]]

- **2026-08-30 -- flipping a surface to DEFAULT re-scopes every defect it already carried.** Making the native browser the default changed no line of it and changed what three of its properties mean: `measured` non-ASCII server names were mangled (`std::wstring(s.begin(), s.end())` widens BYTES, so a Cyrillic name renders one garbage glyph per byte -- harmless dark, a REGRESSION against the ImGui incumbent once on); `BuildScreen` retried every menu tick forever on a missing donor; and CONNECT had never been clicked by anything. **Reviewing the flip's DIFF finds none of it** -- that diff is a boolean and a routing function. **Look here FIRST:** before flipping any dev flag to a shipped default, grep every caller that names the OLD path literally (five did here, including four failure-recovery paths that would have handed the player the other surface); read the new surface end to end for text encoding, unbounded loops and un-latched retries -- the three things a dark surface is never punished for; and prove the ONE user action it exists for actually runs. [[lesson-flipping-a-surface-to-default-rescopes-every-defect-it-carries]]

- **An instrument that shares the defect CANCELS it -- worse than a blind one.** 2026-08-30: the
  native browser's row hit test compared `GetCursorPos` (DESKTOP) to `WidgetScreenRect` (Slate
  CLIENT pixels), off by the window's client origin. `[V]` 1008 probe lines: `cursor
  desktop=(1282,718) client=(962,538) clientOrigin=(320,180) panel (796,496) 968x470 ->
  hit(desktop)=-1 hit(client)=0` -- the pointer physically on a row, the shipped comparison finding
  nothing. **Every automated run passed anyway**, because `server_browser_selftest.cpp` placed its
  cursor by handing widget rects STRAIGHT to `SetCursorPos` at six of its seven sites, under a
  comment asserting *"Slate's absolute space is desktop pixels, the same space SetCursorPos takes,
  so this needs no ClientToScreen and no DPI factor"*. The harness aimed at `rect` and production
  tested against `rect`: they agreed perfectly while both were 180 px from the pixels a human sees.
  `ROW SELECT PASS` was a true statement about the harness and a false one about the product. (The
  seventh site, the X button, DID convert -- which is why the close-button phase was the one
  behaving.) *Look FIRST:* when a test and the code under test perform the SAME conversion, the test
  proves consistency, never correctness -- ask what its ground truth is, and if the answer is "the
  same function the product calls", there is none. For anything spatial the external reference is
  the human or the OS. And log BOTH candidate answers on one line so a single run picks the
  direction: mine had the sign backwards, which is why the probe shipped in its own commit.
  `memory/lesson-an-instrument-that-shares-the-defect-cancels-it.md`

- **Two corrections in OPPOSITE directions mean the derivation is the defect.** Same hit test,
  2026-08-30: corrected once for the client origin (hit zone above the drawing), and the user
  reported it again the other way -- *"the upper row got selected only when I lowered my cursor so
  much towards the center"*. The cursor-to-`LocalToAbsolute` relationship is not one term but at
  least two, the client origin AND the viewport UI scale, and they behave differently: an origin is
  a constant shift, a scale is proportional and grows down a list. The third attempt derives
  nothing -- `umg::CursorToWidgetAbsolute` runs Slate's own inverse
  (`USlateBlueprintLibrary::ScreenToWidgetAbsolute`), correct whether or not the scale reading is
  right. *Look FIRST:* the trigger is the SECOND correction, not the second bug. When a framework
  produced a value it can usually un-produce it; reconstructing its transform from `GetCursorPos`
  plus arithmetic is the harder and unverifiable route. And a correction that only holds on the rig
  you tested (origin is 0 in fullscreen, scale is 1 at 100% UI) is not a fix.

- **A census gate's printed COUNT catches what its verdict cannot.** 2026-08-30, building
  `tools/net/master_contact_gate.py`: three defects in the gate, and the verdict caught one.
  (a) `connect\s*\(` flagged five files whose only sin was English -- `// connect (client log ...)`
  and `"for connect (opacity..."`; a C call has no space there. (b) Stripping string literals to fix
  (a) ALSO stripped the endpoints, which live in literals -- the gate reported **0 FAIL while
  counting 2 endpoints instead of 7**, green and measuring almost nothing. (c) `/v1/lobbies` reaches
  `http::Get` as a VARIABLE, so a literal-only pattern counted six where there are seven -- the
  original census's blind spot one level down. Only (a) was a failure; (b) and (c) were visible ONLY
  because the gate prints `N endpoints across M files` and N was checkable against a hand census.
  *Look FIRST:* a census gate has TWO properties -- does it fail on the bad thing, and does it SEE
  what it claims to cover -- and RED-arm drills only test the first (a mutation in a file the
  scanner now skips is simply not seen). Print the census, check the cardinality once against an
  independent count, and give two rules that read the same input for opposite reasons two views
  rather than one shared "clean" one.

- **A HASH ANSWERS THE QUESTION YOU ENCODED, NOT THE ONE YOU ASKED (2026-07-30).** To answer "do
  these two codepoints DRAW the same", the instrument hashed each glyph as `(contours, ADVANCE)`.
  Advance is not ink — it positions the NEXT glyph — and including it split ten pairs that an
  independent bitmap census found identical at **59 of 59** sizes (`C`≡`Ⅽ`, `Κ`≡`K`, `ѕ`≡`ꜱ`…).
  Dropping it: 382 → 419 pairs. The extra field looked like RIGOUR ("same shape AND same metrics"),
  which is why it survived review. **Look FIRST: enumerate the hash's fields and strike each against
  the question's WORDING; and when a cheap noisy instrument keeps finding what your rigorous one
  misses, suspect the rigorous one — noise adds findings at random, systematic misses do not.**
  → [[lesson-a-hash-answers-the-question-you-encoded-not-the-one-you-asked]]

- **A CRITERION CHOSEN FOR STABILITY MAY NOT ANSWER THE DEFECT — try inverting the QUANTIFIER
  (2026-07-30).** A census of "codepoints identical at SOME sampled size" grew **774 → 963** as the
  grid went from 6 points to 59: an answer that moves when you sample harder is a site list, not an
  invariant. The cure was not sampling harder but flipping ∃ to ∀ — "identical at EVERY sampled
  size" is an intersection, so a denser grid can only SHRINK it. **Look FIRST: when a sampled
  measurement will not converge, invert the quantifier before widening the sample; and state which
  DIRECTION the residual runs — "over-folded, safe direction" was half a characterisation while the
  same table was under-folding by a set nobody had counted.**

- **A TABLE DESCRIBING ANOTHER SUBSYSTEM'S EXTENT ROTS WHEN THAT SUBSYSTEM GROWS (2026-07-30).**
  `FoldCase` case-folded ASCII, Latin-1 and Cyrillic, and its comment called those "exactly the
  cased scripts the repertoire draws". TRUE when written. Two later widenings (Latin-Ext/Greek, then
  the flip's +4,741 codepoints) never touched the function, so nothing compiled differently and no
  test spoke — and **649 of 890 cased-and-drawable codepoints silently folded to THEMSELVES**. None
  folded WRONG: incomplete, never incorrect, which is why it was invisible (a missing fold just
  leaves two names undeduplicated, and a lobby with no collision looks like a healthy one).
  **Look FIRST: grep for comments of the shape "exactly the X that Y" — any constant whose
  justification quantifies over a set owned ELSEWHERE needs a CENSUS, not a sentence. And the cure
  is TWO mechanisms: freeze the data (reproducible) AND census it live (the claim); freezing alone
  reproduces the defect with better provenance.**

- **A CONVERGED DESIGN PASS CAN REST ON AN UNMEASURED ROOT.** 2026-07-31: a 20-round `/qf`
  converged on a cursor-OWNERSHIP design (per-frame invariant, seed target, shadow rollout, three
  gates). The FIRST measurement run after it ended found a completely different root — a truncated
  multiplier — and every ownership construct dissolved. The warning was inside the transcript three
  rounds running: R16 *"the stated root explains the PROBE's run, not the USER's symptom"*, R17 the
  stated mechanism recomputed to the OPPOSITE verdict, R16 again `mm=1` meaning the mouse may never
  have entered the window. The pass answered each by designing better GATES around the premise
  instead of going and measuring it — "measure before building" had quietly become "keep designing
  until it is time to measure". Convergence means the critic stopped finding problems **with the
  design**; a fresh critic reads the brief the primary wrote, so a wrong-but-coherent root makes
  every question land on the superstructure and every answer genuinely improve it. *Look FIRST:* the
  moment a round says the root is not established, STOP DESIGNING AND MEASURE — and ask "which of
  my rounds survive if the root flips?" If the answer is *none*, the pass is on credit. (This does
  NOT repeal [run `/qf` to convergence] — run it, but not on an unmeasured root. The same 20 rounds
  paid for themselves on the KEY-BINDING half, whose facts WERE measured as it went.)
  `memory/lesson_a_converged_design_pass_can_rest_on_an_unmeasured_root.md`

- **ONE DOMAIN WORD CAN NAME TWO DIFFERENT SUBSYSTEMS — and the collision happens in the PLANNING
  layer, where nobody is measuring.** 2026-07-31, caught by the USER in one sentence: *"What do you
  mean VOTV console on F10? By console initially i meant in game server console."* VOTV has TWO
  consoles that share nothing — UE4's **developer** console (opened by a KEY,
  `UInputSettings.ConsoleKeys`, `Tilde` cooked / **`F10`** on this box because the player rebound
  it) and the **in-world SAT server terminal** (`Uui_console_C` / `panel_SATconsole`, **no key** —
  walk up and press `E`, types through Slate focus on its `UEditableTextBox` @0x0268). Issue #5's
  `sv.request` is the SECOND. The fact base had them separated correctly; a GATE was nevertheless
  planned as "press F10 and type", which would have tested a surface no affected player ever opens.
  Both measurements were RIGHT — they were merged by a NOUN, in prose, and then survived 20 rounds
  of interrogation because every question about "the console" got a coherent answer about one of
  them. *Look FIRST:* when a domain word appears in two measurements taken for different reasons,
  write both definitions side by side before either enters a plan; the user's own vocabulary is the
  arbiter (*"server consoles"*, plural, was in the first message); and **a test whose SHAPE is
  suspiciously easy is a warning** — convenience selected the wrong subject here, the same pull as
  [search prior art by problem, not by assumed mechanism].
  `memory/lesson_one_domain_word_can_name_two_different_subsystems.md`
- **Kill-teardown discards buffered INFO log lines — an "empty" log is not "nothing ran".** 2026-08-21,
  spike drill b2: `log.cpp Write()` flushes only WARN/ERROR (the 2026-05-27 fps decision), and every
  autonomous teardown is `TerminateProcess` (mp.py `kill_all`, cell scripts) — the INFO tail dies in the
  CRT buffer. b133 booted FULLY (its module sat in the kernel module list) while its log held one line,
  the fflushed Init banner; it nearly read as "never booted". The spike-lane logs looked complete only
  because the new code `Flush()`es at its own milestones. *Look FIRST:* after any killed process, trust
  only lines at-or-before the last WARN/ERROR/explicit-Flush; corroborate "did X run" with kernel facts
  (module lists, files created); a drill that NEEDS an INFO line to survive puts a Flush in the path
  under test or ends with WM_CLOSE. **Sharpened 2026-08-22: a QUIET SCREEN (the main menu) buries the
  tail indefinitely — two D1 differential runs read as "no injection" because the re-injection INFO
  lines sat buffered for 25+ s until the kill. Recipe: any instrument whose evidence is INFO lines read
  after a kill OWNS a `ue_wrap::log::Flush()` at its final marker (menutravel DONE + wire_census Tick
  both do now).** `memory/lesson_kill_teardown_discards_buffered_info_log_lines.md`

- **2026-08-22 -- Python piped through the harness Git-Bash heredoc HALVES backslash runs even with
  a QUOTED delimiter; any script containing `\` must go through the Write tool to a .py file.**
  Hit 3x in one session (0-hit exact matches on C++ containing `L"\/"`, unicodeescape and
  unterminated-literal SyntaxErrors) + once in the 08-21 spike; the identical bytes via a file ran
  clean every time. LOOK FIRST: a heredoc script mysteriously not matching / erroring on a
  backslash = rerun via a Write-tool file before debugging the script itself.
  `memory/lesson_bash_heredoc_halves_backslashes_in_python.md`
- **Mechanical tractability is NOT reachability — census the world before picking which member of a
  defect class to fix first.** A 7-round `/qf` converged on `prop_pointSack` as consumer-one of the
  credit lane on entirely sound mechanical grounds (class-constant value, plain destroy-edge artifact,
  none of the coin/RNG/pickup machinery that got the coin gun cut) — and it is placed in **0 of the
  261 cooked `.umap` files**, fewer than the gun already cut for being unused; the most-placed paying
  props (`atm` 10, `prop_miner` 7) are the ones blocked on other lanes. The two axes are independent
  and here they were inversely ordered. **A `/qf` cannot catch this for you** — the critic interrogates
  the frame it is handed, so a target named in the brief's first line gets refined, never replaced.
  The tell was in plain sight: zero occurrences in `docs/`. LOOK FIRST: run
  `grep -rl <class> --include=*.umap research/pak_re/extracted` at ROUND 0, and put the target itself
  in the brief as a question.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-24, ONE DAY LATER, same author — this time about SEVERITY.** A kerfur gate
  defect was traced correctly at the mechanism level and written up as the "SIXTH **live shipped**
  defect, ordered STRICTLY FIRST" with no reachability census — while both field logs' session-end
  `CONTAINMENT SUMMARY` already read `catch{off=0 on=0}`, i.e. zero conversions occurred and the defect
  was **latent**. **Generalisation: a correct mechanism trace is not measurement either.** It feels like
  one because it produces real citations, but it establishes only that the defect CAN fire. The sentence
  that earns a severity word is *"and the triggering condition occurred N times in the run, measured at
  `<file:line>`"* — if you cannot write it, do not write the word.
  `memory/lesson_mechanical_tractability_is_not_reachability.md`
- **A CLASS DEFAULT is agreement by construction — check for one before arguing about sync.** Asked
  whether the host's copy carries the same value the client just earned, the reflex was a sync argument
  (keyed, save-transferred). The real answer was one level down: `prop_pointSack.points` is **never
  written** (18-statement ubergraph, read-only, zero `Random*`, no spawner sets it) and lives in the
  class default (base 25, `_xs` 5, `_s` 10, `_l` 50). Every peer loads the same cooked asset, so both
  agree by construction — stronger than any lane argument, and it collapsed a resolve-the-actor branch
  out of the design (the arbiter needs only the CLASS, which `PropSpawn` already carries). **Never
  generalise by field name:** `points` on the sibling `baocoin_C` IS spawner-stamped
  (`SetIntPropertyByName`). LOOK FIRST: grep the owning asset for writes to the field and the corpus
  for a `Set*PropertyByName('<field>')` spawner; if nothing writes it, read the class default and stop.
  `memory/lesson_a_class_default_is_agreement_by_construction.md`

- **A selftest that RE-IMPLEMENTS the path it tests can pass while the shipped code is wrong.**
  `join_seed::RunSelfTest` computes its delta inside the test body, so it verifies the author's model
  of the algorithm and can never fail when the shipped `Seeder` diverges from it. What blocks that is
  making the arithmetic callable: pass the state and the clock IN (`ApplyPose(Row&, gen, pos, stateMs,
  nowMs)`) instead of reaching for a file-scope array and `Clock::now()`. Production passes its row
  under the mutex, the test passes its own -- **same function both times**, the test cannot touch
  production state, and every branch a two-peer LAN smoke cannot reach (a 24-bit clock wrap, an 8 s
  network gap, a slot recycling to a new occupant, a drained receive queue) becomes reachable
  instantly. It found TWO CRITICALs in `movement_ledger` the day it was written. And when the thing
  guarded fails SILENTLY -- a verdict that merely reads wrong -- run it UN-GATED at session start
  rather than behind an env var; this one costs microseconds.
  `memory/lesson_a_selftest_that_reimplements_the_path_it_tests.md`
- **A smoke shorter than an instrument's reporting period proves nothing about the instrument.** A
  35 s smoke returned PASS while the new ledger's 10 s summary line had printed ZERO times: the client
  connected at T+34 s, so the row armed one second before the peers were killed. Nothing warned --
  the driver's verdict is about peer stability and RAM, and "no line" reads identically to the two
  states the module was built to distinguish (`n=0` = armed but starved, no line = dead). Connect
  costs ~30 s in this project, so **set `--duration` from connect-time + N x period**, then GREP THE
  LOG FOR THE NEW LINE AND COUNT IT rather than trusting PASS. Better: make the driver assert it --
  `tools/mp.py` now exits 11 when the ledger's selftest line is missing on either peer, with distinct
  messages for "never ran" and "FAIL rows".
  `memory/lesson_a_smoke_shorter_than_the_reporting_period.md`

- **The number you quoted refutes the label you gave it — read a run's CONDITIONS off its own output.**
  A 120 s autonomous smoke was written up in three documents as the "client idle" baseline, with
  `maxImplied=0..859 cm/s` and `maxStep=0..15 cm` quoted on the very next line. 859 cm/s is between the
  game's walk speed and its sprint ceiling; an idle client reports 0, and three of eight windows did
  exactly that while five did not. A person had joined the autonomous test and played through it. The
  data was fine; the LABEL was invented, and the refutation was on the same screen. It cost real
  strength: the sample was human play, not a floor, which makes `wireVsActor=0 cm` *measured while
  moving* a much stronger claim and adds a live no-false-positive result. Getting the conditions right
  also exposed the honest limit the wrong label hid — a 14.6 cm step is under the ceiling the pre-fix
  arithmetic imposed, so **the broken build would have passed that session too**. LOOK FIRST: before
  writing "idle" / "stationary" / "solo" / "unattended", check the word against the numbers you are
  already pasting. `memory/lesson_the_number_you_quoted_refutes_the_label_you_gave_it.md`
- **Disproving a COMMENT does not disprove the CODE — and the disproof inherits the comment's
  frame.** Measured 2026-08-29: `atv_sync.cpp:123` said *"a bought ATV is delivered ONLY on the
  host"*; 473 `list_store` rows and 189 craft recipes sell no ATV, so the comment is false. I wrote
  across four docs that the lane it introduces was therefore **"gated for RULE-2 deletion"**. Wrong,
  and the deletion would have been a regression: the code's predicate (`:313-318`) is
  `isHost && key not-in g_savePlacedKeys && obj not-in g_savePlacedActors` = *"an ATV first seen
  after the baseline window"* — broader than the comment and **correct**, because a runtime ATV
  really exists. The trap is that a false comment feels like a defect in the *lane*, and RULE 2
  supplies the motive while the false premise supplies what looks like the evidence. The costs are
  asymmetric: a stale comment misleads a reader, a deleted lane silently breaks a real scenario.
  Second layer: the comment said "bought", so I censused the SHOP — **a disproof can only tell you
  the stated reason is wrong, never that no reason exists.** LOOK FIRST: read the predicate the code
  actually evaluates, census THAT, and write the pair side by side ("comment says X; code tests Y").
  A predicate broader than its comment is usually the code being right. Then fix the comment — that
  is the whole defect. `memory/lesson_disproving_a_comment_does_not_disprove_the_code.md`
- **A census of CODE cannot see a DATA-driven call — and a negative without a denominator is an
  anecdote.** Measured 2026-08-29, three stages that each reversed the last: (1) 285 dumped
  blueprints walked for spawn calls naming ATV -> **0 hits**, a clean complete-feeling negative;
  (2) mounting the pak reported **20,873 packages**, so that sample was **1.4%** — the whole-pak
  byte-scan for the FName `ATV_C` plus its NUL terminator (written in words -- a literal NUL made git treat this whole file as BINARY) (uncompressed pak; bisect each hit offset into the sorted
  `provider.files` span table) found 104 owners, 23 non-map, all of which disassembled clean, still
  "no"; (3) the real answer was in **data** — `list_props` row `atv` carries
  `spawnAsObject = ATV_C`, `hidden = false`, and `lib.PropToObject` does
  `GetDataTableRowFromName(list_props, prop)` then uses `row.spawnAsObject` as the class. **The
  spawn site's operand is a table lookup, so no bytecode walk for a class constant could ever find
  it.** Two independent failures, either alone sufficient: sample-read-as-population (nothing in a
  corpus announces its own coverage) and code-read-as-behaviour. LOOK FIRST: state the denominator
  before believing a negative, then grep the DATATABLES for a row whose class field resolves to your
  target — and resolve the import INDEX, never the name-table text (`ATV_C` is a prefix of
  `ATV_Child`, so a substring count lies). The pattern to hunt is
  `GetDataTableRowFromName(<table>, <name>)` feeding a class/target field.

- **The `lessons_gate` now exists — this ledger is machine-checked.**
  `python tools/docs/lessons_gate.py` fails on a cited `file.ext:NNN` that does not resolve (or whose
  line is past EOF) and on a backticked symbol present in **no code corpus** (`src`/`include`/`tools`,
  the auto-memory, MTA, RE-UE4SS, the dumped game bytecode, vendored third-party). **`docs/` is
  deliberately NOT a corpus** — a doc mentioning a symbol must never be what proves it exists, or the
  ledger validates itself. Git SHAs are filtered, a suffix-only cite is reported as PARTIAL rather
  than failed, and two allowlists carry the legitimately-external cases. Shown RED on each defect
  class by `tools/docs/lessons_gate_drill.py`. Its first run found three live rot instances in this
  file -- `hud.cpp` line 415 (the file is 401 lines; live site `hud.cpp:319-328`), `net_pump.cpp`
  line 1014 (838 lines; live site `net_pump.cpp:766`), and `DiscardBakes` ->
  `ImFontAtlasBuildDiscardBakes` -- plus the same stale `net_pump` cite in a source comment.
  **Note the shape of that first list: a dead pointer must never be written in CITATION FORM even
  as a historical quotation, or the ledger re-introduces the rot it is documenting.** The gate
  caught exactly that regression in this row minutes after it was written.

- **Presence in `GUObjectArray` is NOT presence in the WORLD — and the bad samples are ZEROS, which
  look like data.** Measured 2026-08-29: a scan-hub consumer received the save-placed ATV for ~15
  samples (7.5 s) before that actor had a transform. Class matched, every field read cleanly, and the
  game's own `vehicleGetParts()` **succeeded and returned zeros** — nothing fails, so there is no
  error to notice. Left in, they turned the probe's headline statistic from `susFR range 2.59 cm /
  sd 0.34` into `94.98 cm / sd 19.69` — a **20x** error, reading as the *interesting* answer. Object-
  array membership is an ALLOCATION fact; a placed `RootComponent` is a LEVEL-STREAMING fact, and a
  cooked map separates them by seconds. LOOK FIRST: give any object-array-fed probe a LIVENESS
  predicate distinct from existence (a non-zero world transform is the cheap one), and put the guard
  in the PARSER so no consumer can inherit the bug (`tools/atv_probe_report.py` does, with the reason
  in a comment). When a spread surprises you, check its MIN is physically possible.

- **A result that CONFIRMS your hypothesis is where to look hardest — attribution is the step that
  feels like it needs no evidence.** Measured 2026-08-29: the ATV probe returned exactly the shape the
  C1 design predicted (client rig travel 29.58 cm vs the host's 2.32, bodies 109.9 cm apart) and I
  wrote it up as the pose stream deforming the mirror. Wrong. One line in the same log, seconds away:
  `atv: OnAtvRelease -- physics re-enabled + launch velocity applied (|lin|=158 cm/s)` — and **every**
  out-of-band client sample is after it. The client's ATV had been launched and rolled away under its
  own physics. The measurement was real and correctly computed; only the ATTRIBUTION was wrong. Note
  the asymmetry that makes this expensive: a result that contradicts you gets audited immediately, so
  a wrong contradicting result self-corrects — a confirming one is filed, and survives into the design
  doc as a measured premise. The second half of the trap: I read the log **for my variable** (the
  `[ATVP]` tag) instead of reading the **window**. LOOK FIRST: grep the timestamp range, not the tag;
  find the FIRST out-of-band sample and ask what happened immediately before it; name one alternative
  cause and what would distinguish it; and record the wrong reading AS wrong (`docs/vehicles/ATV.md`
  §13.4) so the next reader knows the obvious interpretation was tried and failed.

- **A lane that only exists under AUTHORITY is invisible at rest — the instrument must CREATE the
  condition.** Measured 2026-08-29: `atv_sync.cpp:717` releases an unauthored ATV instead of mirroring
  it, and nothing streams one, so while nobody drives **there is no mirror in existence to measure**.
  A two-peer smoke with a probe therefore cannot answer "do a mirror's wheels follow its body" no
  matter how long it runs — it produces no signal and no error, which is indistinguishable from
  "measured it and it was fine". Worse, the null result READS as reassuring: the peers agreed to
  0.3 cm because neither was mirroring anything. Fix: a host-only one-shot arm calling the game's own
  `ATV_C::playerSit(localPlayer)` — the verb, not a synthetic state write. LOOK FIRST: before
  instrumenting a lane, grep the RECEIVER for the predicate that switches it on (`authored`,
  `isAuthority`, `preparedAsMirror`, a claim/holder check) and confirm it will be true during the run;
  if it needs a player action, the instrument owes a separately-gated, host-scoped, one-shot arm. And
  when a probe reports "the peers agree", ask whether the mechanism worked or never ran.

- **A scripted edit must PRESERVE the file's newline convention, not choose one.** Measured
  2026-08-29: a 4-line insert into `config_registry_rows.inc` written with `newline="
"` flipped the
  whole CRLF file to LF — **763 changed lines** for a 4-line edit. Three things hid it: the same call
  had been correct on ten other files that session (most of this tree is LF); the per-line diff shows
  the same text on both sides, reading as noise; and the build plus `registry_gate.ps1` both passed,
  because nothing mechanical objects to an ending flip. The cost lands hardest exactly here — that
  `.inc` was **already modified by another live session**, so staging it would have buried their hunks
  inside mine in a file neither of us could review by eye (`docs/CROSS_SESSION.md`). LOOK FIRST: write
  with `newline=""` so Python round-trips the existing endings, or restore from `git show HEAD:<path>`
  and re-apply; then READ `git diff --stat` before staging and check the count matches the size of
  your edit. Staging an explicit path does not save you if the file's own bytes were rewritten.

- **A COUNTER YOU NEVER PRINT IS NOT AN INSTRUMENT — and a verdict that cannot attribute blames the
  nearest subsystem.** 2026-08-29, ATV arc 1, two halves of one failure. (1) The corrector shipped with
  `g_warps`/`g_corrs` and a comment saying "a corrector nobody can see is a corrector nobody can
  falsify" — incremented, printed **nowhere**, one line below that comment. Three build/deploy/run
  cycles could not answer *is it running at all*, and two were spent on hypotheses a single log line
  would have ordered. The moment one line printed, the answer was neither hypothesis. (2) The acceptance
  arm read "40.5 cm apart -> FAIL" and pointed at the vehicle lane, which was working perfectly; the
  distinguishing evidence was already in the same log (**repeated cuts at a CONSTANT distance** = the
  rig WAS teleported onto the authority's pose and fell back = a world-geometry fact, not a pose-lane
  one). *Look FIRST:* add a counter's PRINT in the same edit or do not add the counter; when an
  acceptance arm fails, ask what other evidence in the same log separates "my code did not act" from
  "my code acted and something undid it", and teach the report that; and when chasing a discrepancy
  across builds the first question is always "did my code run", never "is my algorithm right".

- **2026-08-30 — A threshold borrowed from another REGIME fails the authority itself; and a
  one-sided test is blind in the direction it does not check.** `[V]` The ATV acceptance graded a
  DRIVEN mirror's suspension against `BAND_CM = 4.0`, a figure honestly measured on a **parked** rig.
  The first driven run "failed" at 6.81/5.50/4.12 cm while the AUTHOR's own natively-driven rig
  travelled 4.68/4.19/6.59 cm — a test the authority fails is not a test of the mirror. The fix is not
  a bigger constant but a comparison INSIDE the run: mirror vs author, same window, same seconds.
  Worse, because the old test had only a CEILING it could not see the failure it existed to detect —
  the drill's own `healthy()` control emitted a mirror whose front wheels never moved at all, the
  frozen corpse the mirror model was built to prevent, and nine RED arms had never contradicted it.
  *Look FIRST:* write down the REGIME a measured constant came from (parked/driven/idle/cold) before
  reusing it as a threshold, and prefer a same-run comparison to any constant. Ask of every threshold
  "which side is it on, and what does the other side look like". A fixture is written to pass, so it
  drifts toward whatever the assertions do not check.
  `memory/lesson_a_threshold_from_another_regime_fails_the_authority_itself.md`

- **2026-08-30 — When a defect is blamed on a PLACE, move the subject and re-measure; until you have,
  the attribution is a hypothesis wearing a `[V]`.** `[V]` A constant ~40 cm cross-peer Z gap that
  SURVIVED a full rig teleport was written into `docs/vehicles/ATV.md` §14.6 as "the peers' worlds
  differ under the parking spot", and the report was even taught to attribute that signature. Every
  observation was true; the inference was wrong. One experiment separated them — drive the ATV. The
  copies start **3.5 cm** apart at the spot and end **39.6 cm** apart 4 km away: the gap is ACQUIRED
  during the drive, so it is this lane's, not the world's. The confound was that every measurement had
  been taken at the same place, because nothing could drive the vehicle — a limit of the rig, invisible
  from inside the reasoning. *Look FIRST:* name the condition you never varied before concluding
  anything, because the constant you did not vary is what your explanation is secretly about; and hold
  an attribution that sends the next session to a DIFFERENT subsystem to a higher bar, since being
  wrong costs them the whole trip.
  `memory/lesson_move_the_thing_before_blaming_the_place.md`

- **2026-08-30 — Two constants from two codebases are not comparable until their UNITS are; a correct
  citation does not carry them.** `[V]` I put our ATV warp threshold `kWarpBaseCm + kWarpPerSpeedS*|v|`
  = `200 + 0.5*|v|` **cm** beside MTA's `CClientVehicle::UpdateTargetPosition:3867` `15 + 10*|v|` and
  published "small base, large speed term — the opposite shape, it tightens as the vehicle speeds up
  where ours stays flat". Every number was quoted right and the comparison is meaningless: MTA's is
  `(15 + 10*|v|) * GetGameSpeed() * TICK_RATE / 100` (`CClientVehicle.cpp:77-78`,
  `CTickRateSettings.h:16` -> factor ≈1) compared against a distance in **GTA world units**, so a
  15-unit base is ~1500 cm — **7.5x LOOSER than ours, the opposite of the claim** — and MTA's velocity
  units are established nowhere in the vendored tree, so the speed terms are not commensurable at all.
  The correction inverted the work: "our threshold is too loose" said retune the warp; what actually
  holds (`trail ~ 0.0063*speed^1.52`, warp never fired) says the net is a last resort our runs never
  needed and the trail is the CORRECTOR's convergence rate. **The units fact was already in our tree**:
  `atv_corrector.cpp:28-29` (moved there by the 2026-08-30 extraction; it was `atv_sync.cpp:103-104` when I quoted it), three lines above the constant, says *"their 15 + 10*|v| is in GTA
  units"* — whoever ported the number did the conversion and wrote it down, and I read MTA's file
  without reading our own four lines around the value. *Look FIRST:* read the comment around YOUR OWN
  constant before comparing it to prior art; then read the COMPARISON SITE, not the `#define`, and
  write down the unit and the quantity each constant is measured against; if either is unknown, stop
  and say so. Only ours had its unit in its identifier. Prefer dimensionless
  shapes (a ratio, an exponent) over raw coefficients — the `v^1.52` fit survived because an exponent
  has no units.
  `memory/lesson_two_constants_are_not_comparable_until_their_units_are.md`

- **2026-08-30 — A line number is a POSITION; the claim is about CONTENT, and only content can check
  it.** `[V]` An extraction moved five cited facts out of `atv_sync.cpp` and `lessons_gate` printed
  *"PASS -- every cited file:line resolves"* in the same session that created the rot: three of the
  five were lesson rows I had written hours earlier, `atv_sync.cpp:103-104` had become **blank lines**
  (the fact was now `atv_corrector.cpp:28-29`), and `:453` had become `g_installed = true`. The gate
  was not broken — `check A` verifies the path resolves and the line is not past EOF
  (`lessons_gate.py:185-211`), and a 841-line file swallows every one of those numbers. **Length is
  exactly what a refactor preserves.** FIXED: check A2 — where a row QUOTES the cited line
  (`` `file:line` says "..." ``), the quote must still be within ±25 lines, and the gate prints the
  corrected line when it moved or says so when it left the file. Narrow on purpose (the first cut
  matched any nearby quotation → six false positives; a gate people ignore is worse than none), and
  drilled RED then GREEN. *Look FIRST:* after any extraction/move/rename, grep the doc tree for
  `<movedfile>:[0-9]` and check hits by CONTENT — A2 covers only citations that QUOTE, so a bare
  `file:453` still passes on anything. When writing a row, quote the line you cite: the quote is what
  makes a citation checkable. And read any gate's PASS sentence as its literal specification — the
  words are usually exactly right and narrower than the reassurance they give.
  **AND THE NAMED RESIDUAL LANDED WITHIN 24 HOURS, in the same file, from the same cause
  (2026-08-30):** this row's own advice says *"a bare `file:453` still passes on anything"*, and the
  very next day `ATV.md`'s §14.6 box cited `atv_corrector.cpp:125-126` for the claim that both cut
  paths write a velocity right after the teleport — true when written, and moved out from under the
  citation hours later by the fix that section was introducing. A2 could not see it because the row
  cites without QUOTING. So the residual is not theoretical and the remedy is not the gate: **quote
  the line, or expect the citation to rot silently.**

**A correct mechanism is what makes a wrong conclusion feel solid.** I stated that foreign cards cannot pay a Russian donation platform and built a recommendation on it; the user called it, and ninety seconds of checking showed the platform officially accepts them (failures are issuer-side, not a wall). The mechanism I reasoned from was TRUE -- Visa/MC cut cross-border processing with Russian banks in 2022 -- and the leap from "how this class of thing works" to "how THIS service's checkout works today" was unearned. Sound reasoning leaves no moment of doubt to catch. **Look here FIRST:** a claim about the OUTSIDE world is still a claim, and the check is usually one search. Three tells -- you are asserting an external service's current behaviour from a general mechanism plus a date; it is trivially checkable and you did not check; and you are recommending WORK on the strength of it. When corrected, fix it at every place you wrote it, not only the one in front of the user. **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-30, and it SHIPPED a bug:** I wrote that a restored scroll offset "is clamped by the next layout" -- Slate does clamp what it ARRANGES with, so the mechanism was real -- while `GetScrollOffset` reports `DesiredScrollOffset` and applies no clamp, so the over-large value is STORED and the next structural change reads it back as a real position. The measurement was already in the header of the function I was calling, IN CAPITALS (`ue_wrap/engine/umg_build.h:159-171`, measured twice on 2026-08-26); an audit quoted it back at me. **Fourth tell: you are about to state how a CALLEE behaves and you have not opened its declaration** -- in this project the measured fact is usually there, put there by someone already burned. **THIRD INSTANCE 2026-08-30 (VotvIO v15), with the antidote:** I asserted "UE inherits bVisible down the attach chain" from ONE family that fit (the prying-crowbar rig, invisible in game under f_visible=False pivots) and generalised it into a hidden-check -- the game's grime rigs also hang under f_visible=False parents and RENDER, so the check killed 947 of 979 projected decals. **Fifth tell: one family fitting a mechanism is correlation on that family; before generalising, run the check against a DIFFERENT family that must not change** (the bench's full report diff was the one-run falsifier; the revert landed the honest curated-class mechanism instead). [[lesson-a-correct-mechanism-is-what-makes-a-wrong-conclusion-feel-solid]]

- **2026-08-30 — Assigning a physics velocity is a WAKE, not just a write.** `[V]` A mirrored
  `AATV_C` free-fell 46 cm in a second while its author held one Z to the decimal and reported
  `|v| = 0.0` (`[ATVC]` lines, `coop/interactables/atv_corrector.cpp`); the peer being written to
  fell, the peer not being written to did not. `SetPhysicsLinearVelocity(bAddToCurrent=false)` on the
  ROOT body of a five-body constraint rig wakes a body that had gone to sleep on its contacts, once
  per packet, and writing the same value it already had is not a no-op. Two mechanisms were proposed
  FIRST and both were wrong — a per-packet ratchet (a ratchet oscillates; this rig was dead flat for
  100+ samples) and a downward velocity over the wire (`|v| = 0.0` kills it) — though the second is
  alive in a different regime, a still-SETTLING author whose real `-40.9` Z we mirror onto a copy that
  has already landed. *Look FIRST:* when a mirrored physics body drifts and the correction looks
  right, do not tune the correction — log the value at the instant it is written and check the peer
  you are NOT writing to. MTA reached the same rule from the other end (`bSyncVelocity`,
  `CUnoccupiedVehicleSync.cpp:194`/`:311`, server `:315-321`).
  `memory/lesson_assigning_a_velocity_is_a_wake_not_just_a_write.md`

- **2026-08-30 — A bound cleared by its own success is not a bound.** `[V]` A give-up arm written to
  re-place a mirror "at most 3 times, then say so" logged its terminal WARN **three times in 46 s**:
  the counter counted CONSECUTIVE failures and cleared on any packet that found the rig in band — and
  a re-place puts the rig exactly on target, so the next packet is the one MOST likely to be in band.
  The reset condition was the expected RESULT of the action being bounded. The mirror image was in the
  same code: where the error re-crosses the deadband every other packet the counter never reaches 3,
  the diagnostic is never emitted, and the action runs forever. *Look FIRST:* for any retry/give-up/
  backoff counter ask what clears it and whether that is a consequence of what it counts; a bound
  needs a clock or an episode boundary the action cannot itself produce. And grep your own WARN in the
  run log and COUNT it — a once-per-episode line appearing N times is the bound failing.
  `memory/lesson_a_bound_cleared_by_its_own_success_is_not_a_bound.md`

- **2026-08-30 — A rule at ONE BRANCH is bypassed by every path above it (and by the half of a
  compound gate you did not mean).** `[V]` "Do not write a velocity onto a mirror whose author is at
  rest" shipped as a single early-return, and two paths went around it: the WARP arm sits earlier in
  the function and still did `TeleportRig` + write, unbounded; and the gate was `linAtRest &&
  angAtRest`, so a parked-but-ROCKING author (`wireLin |v| = 4.63`, under the band) took the full
  write path and the mirror gained **+51 cm/s of Z** — in the very run reported as the fix's evidence.
  The angular constant that did it had no measured provenance; it was 5 by symmetry. Fixed by one rule
  per quantity applied at the WRITE SITE (`WriteMirrorVelocity`), not at a branch some paths skip.
  *Look FIRST:* after writing "do not do X when Y", grep the function for every X and confirm each is
  downstream of the test; then ask which quantity actually causes the harm — the others belong in
  their own gate or in none. Invariant-not-a-site-list, pointed inward at one function.

- **2026-08-30 — When a measurement needs a guard to exclude honest variation, measure the
  DIFFERENTIAL instead and the guard disappears.** `[V]` A new acceptance arm graded one peer's Z
  across an authority handoff and needed a guard to skip the handoff where a peer drives away (that Z
  change is terrain). The guard — "skip if it travelled >50 cm", sized from the few cm a SETTLED rig
  creeps — then skipped the case the arm existed for, because a rig coasting to a stop rolled 68 cm.
  The fix was a better QUANTITY, not a better threshold: grading the change in the GAP BETWEEN THE TWO
  COPIES makes terrain, slope and coasting common-mode, so a peer driving away scores ~0 with **no
  guard at all** (release handoffs +35.5/+31.2/+10.3/+19.6, acquire handoffs negative, four runs).
  *Look FIRST:* before adding a guard to an acceptance arm, ask whether both sides of the comparison
  experience what you are excluding — if they do, subtract instead of excluding. Same trap as
  [[lesson-a-threshold-from-another-regime-fails-the-authority-itself]], same instrument, five days
  apart; a drilled guard that encodes the wrong distinction is still the wrong distinction.
  **RECURRED ONE DAY LATER, ONE ARM LATER, IN THE SAME FILE.** A7 (ride height) shipped asserting an
  absolute band of `8..26 cm`, calibrated on a settled author reading `+16.8..+18.0`. Four
  single-variable runs then read `+19.2 / +16.8 / +4.2 / -0.3` for a **healthy** author, because the
  ATV's parked attitude differs per run — so the arm failed BOTH peers on two of the four cells while
  their rigs agreed to 0.12 cm. Rewritten to grade the SPREAD between the two copies: 0.12 / 0.14 /
  0.44 / 0.61 cm when nothing deforms the mirror, 19.05 / 40.52 cm when something does. Knowing the
  lesson and having written it the previous day did not prevent writing the absolute band first;
  what would have is asking, before the constant, **"does this quantity legitimately vary run to
  run?"** — and if yes, there is a differential to take.
  `memory/lesson_measure_the_differential_and_the_guard_disappears.md`

- **2026-08-30 — One green run after a red streak is not a result, and the archive it would be quoted
  into may not be runs.** `[V]` After five red acceptance runs a fix produced the ATV lane's first
  ever `ACCEPTANCE: PASS` (A2 **7.0 cm** vs a 20 cm criterion, every arm green); the immediate re-run,
  same build, same scenario, failed at **39.7 cm** — and contained the evidence for a SECOND cause the
  passing run did not. A result that flips a streak is the one that most needs repeating, because a
  deterministic effect would not have produced a streak. Separately: the drill invoked the report tool
  without `--no-archive`, so **four of seven directories in `research/atv_runs/` were 14-line
  synthetic fixtures**, told apart from real two-peer runs only by a tempdir path inside a MANIFEST —
  while the design doc's tables had been built by reading those directory names. *Look FIRST:* before
  writing a verdict into a doc, run it twice, and confirm every directory you quote was produced by
  what you think produced it. A harness sharing an output path with the evidence store contaminates it
  invisibly. **AND IT CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY FROM A DIFFERENT CALLER** — see the row below; the fix
  applied here was `--no-archive` at the one known offender, which left the behaviour intact.
  `memory/lesson_one_green_run_after_a_red_streak_is_not_a_result.md`

- **2026-08-30 — When a defect tracks ONE variable, every subsystem keyed on that variable is a
  suspect; two days went to the visible one.** `[V]` A mirrored ATV settled 25-40 cm below its
  author, and ride height was a **pure function of `owns`** — flipping within ~2 s in both
  directions at every handoff, identically signed across six runs. Two things key on `owns`: the
  pose **corrector** (runs only on a non-author) and the **collision guard** (cancels `ComponentHit`
  only on a non-owner). Every fix, both retracted mechanisms and three shipped changes went to the
  corrector, because it was the new, actively-edited code while the guard was `[V]`-documented and
  felt settled. A **four-cell experiment** — two `[dev]` flags, four smoke runs, ~20 minutes —
  acquitted it outright: with the guard off, corrector ON is the *best* of the four cells (A2
  **3.0 cm**), and corrector OFF with the guard on still FAILS at 30.4. *Look FIRST:* a perfect
  correlation with a boolean is evidence about the BOOLEAN, not about any particular consumer of it
  — so enumerate every consumer (here a grep: `OwnsTick` had exactly two, both named in a header
  comment) and put a kill-switch on each BEFORE designing. N flags and 2^N short runs beat any
  amount of mechanism reasoning, and each cell is falsifiable in a way an argument is not. Corollary:
  the subsystem you have been editing is the one you will suspect, which is backwards — recently
  changed code is *better* understood than untouched code.

- **2026-08-30 — Cancelling a notification cancels everything it carried, not the one effect you
  meant; and a census of what a call AUTHORS is not a census of what it DOES.** `[V]` The ATV
  collision guard cancels `ComponentHit` PRE-dispatch on a non-owner so a mirror cannot author
  damage or `explode()` a vehicle its authority still has. It cancelled **all seven** delegates —
  and the five **wheel** ones also maintain the rig's own shape, so the mirror's body sat under its
  own wheel plane in every run ever measured. Cancelling only the two **body** delegates keeps the
  protection and the rig (`8cd0ac25`). **AND THE LESSON HAS A SECOND HALF, LEARNED THE SAME DAY
  (`28a958e8`): the fix was still the wrong SHAPE.** Cancel-vs-permit is a false binary; a PRE-dispatch
  interceptor gets a WRITABLE params frame (`game_thread.h:109`, `bool(*)(void*, void* params)`), so
  the third option is to **mutate the parameter the unwanted effect scales with**. Zeroing
  `NormalImpulse` kills wear, dirt, health loss and `explode()` while the handler still runs and still
  writes `wheelsOnSurface` from its `EX_True` literal. Cancelling is now retired entirely and so is the
  mask. *Look FIRST:* when one notification carries two effects, before you reach for cancel-vs-permit,
  ask which PARAMETER the unwanted effect is a function of -- suppressing a magnitude is often
  available where suppressing a call is not, and it costs no wire bytes. The suppression was built on a careful, accurate, `[V]`
  census — *"impulse() subtracts ... from `health` and calls explode() at <=0, processTire() burns
  tire durability and ejectWheel()s at 0, and the Capsule one pops a lib_C::addHint"* — every clause
  of which is true, and all of which enumerate **authored state**. The two lists differ by exactly
  what a handler does for its OWN machine: bookkeeping, rig maintenance, contact tracking. *Look
  FIRST:* before cancelling or filtering a dispatched callback, write TWO lists — what it does to
  shared state, and what it does for its own peer. If you are stopping the first and the second is
  non-empty, you are about to suppress the second as collateral; split the target or find a narrower
  site (principle 4). A `[V]` tag certifies the observations, never that the right question was asked.

- **2026-08-30 — An acceptance arm built on a quantity blind to the failing axis passes forever, and
  confidently.** `[V]` The ATV arm A1 grades rig deformation from `susFR/susFL/susBK` =
  `Dist(wheel, body)`, an arm that is ~92 cm horizontal and ~17 cm vertical. The defect was a 40 cm
  **vertical** displacement: `sqrt(92^2+16.8^2)=93.5` vs `sqrt(92^2+23.7^2)=95.0`, so it moved the
  graded number by **1.14 cm** — inside the "2-4 cm of normal suspension travel" band A1 asserts. A1
  therefore passed on all six runs in which A2 failed, **on the same vehicle, in the same second**.
  The quantity was not sloppy: it was introduced deliberately as *"|wheel - body| is
  ROTATION-INVARIANT ... THIS is the frozen-corpse measurement"*, which is correct for the question
  it was born for (is the rig frozen?) and silently wrong for the one it was later asked (is the rig
  the wrong SHAPE?). *Look FIRST:* when one arm keeps failing while a neighbouring arm on the SAME
  subject keeps passing, the passing arm is a suspect, not corroboration — compute, arithmetically,
  what a defect of the observed magnitude would do to its number, and if the answer is under its own
  tolerance the arm cannot see this class at all. The disagreement between the two arms WAS the
  finding.

- **2026-08-30 — Patch the BEHAVIOUR, not the caller, or the same defect returns from a different
  one.** `[V]` `tools/atv_probe_report.py` archives whatever it just read into the evidence store.
  2026-08-29: the acceptance drill invoked it on synthetic fixtures, so **four of seven directories
  in `research/atv_runs/` were fixtures** while a design doc's tables cited those directory names —
  fixed by passing `--no-archive` **from the drill**. 2026-08-30, next day: re-grading an archived
  run (`report.py <host.log> <client.log>`) reached the same `archive()` from a different caller;
  with explicit paths `names` becomes the paths themselves, so the destination was
  `<newdir>/<whole source path>.log`, every copy failed, and each invocation left a directory
  holding **nothing but a MANIFEST of `UNREADABLE` lines** — **eight of them among 26**, found only
  because a closing sweep counted directories. One defect both times: a tool that writes to the
  evidence store on every invocation regardless of what it was asked to do. The real fix is three
  words at the decision point (`and paths == DEFAULT`), because archiving means "preserve the LIVE
  logs", which is a property of the INPUT. *Look FIRST:* when a tool damages shared state and you
  reach for a flag at the call site, ask what property of the INPUT should have decided it and
  whether the function can test that itself — if it can, the flag is a workaround wearing a fix's
  clothes (RULE 1). And when the damaged thing is an EVIDENCE STORE, put the census in the closing
  sweep: count the directories, check each holds the artifacts its name implies.

- **2026-08-30 — An "unreadable" sentinel guards the failure you IMAGINED, not the one you get; the
  dangerous read is the one that succeeds with the wrong type and prints something plausible.**
  `[V]` The ATV probe's commit guaranteed *"a missing read prints -1, never 0 — 'identical on both
  peers' and 'unreadable on both peers' are the two readings a census like this most easily
  confuses."* Both were guarded. A third was not: `tirescount` is an `IntProperty`
  (`research/bp_reflection/ATV.json`, `SerializedType=IntProperty`) read with `ReadFloat`, so `4`
  became `5.6e-45` and `%.1f` printed **`0.0`** — on both peers, in every run, for the field's whole
  life. The sentinel could not fire because the offset RESOLVES; nothing failed. Same commit, same
  shape a second time: `wos` read `TArray::Num` on a `TArray<bool>` whose CDO default already holds
  four elements, printing `4` even on an actor with no world transform — and that non-answer was
  written into a design doc as a finding. The commit was titled *"the instrument was blind to the
  only axis that ever failed"*. *Look FIRST:* before a raw-memory read of a reflected property, look
  up its declared `SerializedType` in the dump — one grep — and never infer it from the field's name
  or from what the value looks like. Then check the first sample against something known
  independently (an ATV has four tires). A value constant across peers, across runs, and across a
  state change that should have moved it is not agreement; it is a hint the read never reached it.

- **2026-08-30 — A per-peer RANDOM identity mint forecloses every dedupe plan; find out which kind
  of identity an object has BEFORE choosing the lane's shape.** `[RD]` Chasing whether a
  runtime-spawned `prop_atvWheel_C` carries a Key, the whole mint chain disassembled:
  `ATV.ejectWheel` @107-427 BeginDeferred-spawns it writing only `durability`/`dirt`/`fixes` and no
  key at all -> `prop.UserConstructionScript` @128 calls `init()` -> `prop.init` @1265 `getKey` ->
  `prop.getKey` @11 `lib_C::assignKey` -> **`lib.assignKey` @81-133: `if (keyIn == None) keyIn :=
  generateRandomKey()`**, then the pair is registered into `gamemode.keyObj_key`/`keyObj_obj`. So
  **every** `Aprop_C` a Blueprint spawns at runtime is keyed by the UCS, in the spawning process, at
  RANDOM — the whole prop family, not just wheels. Two peers running the same spawn therefore mint
  two DIFFERENT keys for one logical object, the identity layer keys on that string, and **no
  after-the-fact reconciliation exists** (no dedupe pass, no fuzzy match, no host-wins merge — there
  is no shared value to match on). Any lane where two peers can spawn the same object must be an
  **act-as-host intent lane** (`COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md` §2b); "we will clean up duplicates later" is
  dead before it is written. **The trap:** searching for "where is the key checked" leads to
  `ue_wrap::prop::IsKeyedInteractable`, which does NOT test the key — it is
  `IsClassKeyedInteractable(R::ClassOf(obj))` (`prop.cpp:154`), a pure LINEAGE test that passes on
  class alone; the real instance-key gate is an anonymous inline `keyStr.empty() || keyStr ==
  L"None"` in `GrabObserver_Aprop_Init_POST_Body` (`prop_lifecycle.cpp:276`). The identity-sounding
  NAME sat on the weaker check and the decisive check had none, and a conclusion had already been
  written off the name before the body was opened — the opposite of the truth. *Look FIRST:* before
  designing any cross-peer lane for a runtime-spawnable object, disassemble its key path to the mint
  and classify identity as DERIVED (deterministic, matchable) or MINTED (random, per-process); that
  one fact picks the lane's shape and costs about four `_fn.py` calls. And when a chain has two gates
  for related-sounding properties, assume the named one is not the one you want.
  **AND THE RUNTIME CONFIRMATION COST TWO GREPS, NOT A TEST RUN:** with the chain tagged `[RD]` the
  obvious move was to take the shared game lock, re-instrument the probe, build, deploy and drive an
  ATV into something — but `ignore_folder/arigalit_red_mist_desync/multivoid_host.log`, a PLAYER'S
  FIELD REPORT, already held the event 47 times with 7 distinct 22-char base64-GUID keys, and the
  paired client log had the same 7 and none the host lacked. This project keeps a directory of real
  two-peer sessions (`ignore_folder/*_report/`, `research/atv_runs/`) containing events no scripted
  scenario reproduces, because people played them: **grep those before building an instrument or
  taking the lock.** Then read the build banner, because that is what makes the evidence honest —
  that log is b143, compiled two days before the change whose residual was under investigation, so it
  could confirm the key fact (the game's own BP, version-stable) while being STRUCTURALLY UNABLE to
  test the divergence (the mirror did not simulate yet). "Not observed in the logs" and "the window
  did not exist in that build" are different findings and only the banner separates them.

- **2026-08-30 — An acceptance criterion must name what the DESIGN changes, not what you wish were
  true.** `[V]` The ATV impulse fix (`28a958e8`) stops a MIRROR inventing collision damage, and its
  headline virtue is that it **puts nothing on the wire**. I wrote its acceptance test as "expecting
  the two peers' `dur=` to stay equal" — **a test that design cannot pass**, because peers can only
  agree about wear if something SENDS it. Its correct outcome is *author damaged, mirror pristine*:
  still a disagreement, merely a deterministic one. The verified run showed exactly that (mirror
  `100/100/100/100` vs `98.22/100/100/98.48` before; author `96.24/98.70/100/98.49`). The wrong
  criterion hid a real conclusion — that the fix is **half** of one, the other half being the state
  push dropped an hour earlier as "superseded" because the new fix was "better on every axis". It is
  better on every axis except the one a player experiences. *Look FIRST:* write the criterion in the
  same breath as the design and make it a sentence about the DELTA — what will be different in the
  log because of THIS change. If it names a value the change does not produce, transmit or compute,
  it is grading somebody else's work, and the answer is not a weaker test but "what is the missing
  half?"

- **2026-08-30 — A hand-written inventory is a LIST, not a census; do not do arithmetic on its
  denominator.** `[V]` A design was argued from `docs/vehicles/ATV.md` §10's facet table — *"16
  facets, 3 synced, 13 not, and ten of the thirteen share one wire shape"* — and the ratio used to
  choose a vehicle-wide lane over a per-facet one. The user answered in one line: *"we currently dont
  even sync wheel steer, brake state etc"*. `brake` is in the table; **steering is not in it at all**
  (`[V]` the visible steering is `handleAxis.K2_SetRelativeRotation(MakeRotator(0,20,Lerp(0,x,
  rotAlpha)))` at uber `@38413`, a locally computed per-tick visual). The numerator was fine and the
  **denominator was unknown**. It also exposed a class the three-way split (*double-simulates* /
  *goes stale* / *gated off*) could not hold: a derived per-frame visual with **no stored state to
  diverge**, whose mirror value is never computed because the INPUT is absent — closer to MTA
  keysync than to any prop-state lane. *Look FIRST:* before using an inventory's COUNT in an
  argument, ask how it was built — enumerated mechanically against the thing itself, or accumulated
  as things came up? Only the first has a denominator; the second's honest form is "of the facets we
  have listed". A sixteen-row table with a status column LOOKS like a census, and sits in a document
  otherwise dense with `[V]` measurements, which lends its unmeasured parts borrowed credibility.
  `memory/lesson-a-hand-written-inventory-is-a-list-not-a-census.md`
  **AND IT RECURRED 2026-09-01, in a session that had this row indexed.** I censused which cooked blueprints can move a light group over `research/bp_reflection/*.json` -- the 306 assets that happened to have been dumped -- and concluded ONE driver. Over the actual population (`research/pak_re/extracted`, 3,522 uassets) there are THIRTEEN. A critic caught it by sampling harder, and the tell was in plain sight: **my answer MOVED when the sample grew, which is the definition of a site list.** Look FIRST for the population directory before grepping the convenience one, and when a census yields a suspiciously clean answer ("exactly one caller"), re-run it against the superset before building on it.

- **A TEST ENDS WHEN ITS EVIDENCE IS COLLECTED — the windows die immediately (USER RULE
  2026-08-30).** Verbatim: *"они раз отстреляли свой тест то рубить их нахуй сразу надо, зачем им
  висеть."* A fixed `--duration` is a time envelope around variable-time evidence, and everything
  after evidence-complete is pure exposure: hung windows, the drive arm wandering into the river,
  a KO-respawn hang eating the verdict minutes after the equality evidence was banked (run A,
  2026-08-30 19:03). Machinery: instruments announce their own completion in ONE log line
  (`[ATV-PROBE] DONE`), and `mp.py smoke` kills on `--done-marker` / ends INCONCLUSIVE on
  `--dead-marker` / fail-fasts on a dead session (`b66dc0db`, `e60d516f`). *Look FIRST:* a new
  test lane is not done until its done-line and marker invocation exist; fixed duration is only
  for steady-state/soak runs where time itself is the evidence.
  `memory/feedback-a-test-ends-when-its-evidence-is-collected.md`

- **A COUNTDOWN ANCHORED AT FIRST-ELIGIBILITY FIRES INTO A LAPSE.** 2026-08-30: the eject
  drill armed "fire in 45 s" at the first moment of client authority; the drive arm banks its
  20 s and DISMOUNTS, so the fire moment evaluated `eligible=false` and silently never shot —
  no marker, and the run idled out its full duration (the user watched the hung windows). The
  countdown and the gate were each correct; the defect is their COMPOSITION — time flows while
  the predicate does not. The post-ship audit had NAMED it (MINOR-7) and it shipped
  noted-not-fixed: **an audit finding on an INSTRUMENT is a scheduled run failure, not a backlog
  item.** Fixed `e60d516f`: the anchor resets on lapse, and the delay must FIT INSIDE the
  measured lifetime of the condition it depends on. *Look FIRST:* any one-shot keyed on a
  transient condition (authority/seated/connected/world-ready) — does the anchor reset, and does
  the delay fit the condition's real lifetime?
  `memory/lesson-a-countdown-anchored-at-first-eligibility-fires-into-a-lapse.md`

- **A number that lives ONLY in a code comment is a CLAIM — re-measure it before it rules out a
  design** — `net_pump.cpp` justified the whole flee-to-menu architecture with "the balloon is VOTV's
  OWN possessed-ragdoll leak (~165 MB/s to OOM)", from "4 hands-on + an autonomous probe arc" in June.
  Two tells it deserved re-measuring, both free: `grep -rln "165 MB"` returned TWO source files and
  ZERO finding docs (every other measurement in this project has a dated `research/findings/` home),
  and the sentence NEXT TO IT ("VOTV's native death never leaves the world") was already falsified by
  the bytecode — **when one clause of a two-clause claim is provably wrong, the other is not evidence,
  it is the same author**. Re-measured across four runs: **0.00–0.11 MB/s**, ~1% of the claim. Also
  check the AGE against what has been fixed since (this predated the v122 no-passive-mint fix that
  removed ~2,200 zombie rows/join) and sanity-check the magnitude against the world (165 MB/s means
  vanilla SP spikes 1.6 GB on every death; players would have noticed). **Second half: my DIFFERENTIAL
  was less stable than the raw term** — the dead-window slope held 0.00–0.11 while the differential
  moved 2.32→3.78→6.37, because the alive CONTROL drifted differently each run. A differential only
  beats its raw term when what it subtracts is constant, and a noisy control errs in the flattering
  direction. *Look FIRST:* does the number have a finding doc? If not, it is a claim.
  `memory/lesson-a-number-that-lives-only-in-a-comment-is-a-claim.md`
- **An env-gated test can be unreachable by its own LAUNCHER — a launch configuration is a claim, and
  it is invisible in the output** — TWO instances the same day. (a) `SpawnEnvGatedTests` sat INSIDE
  `harness.cpp`'s net-role branch, so a `VOTVCOOP_RUN_*_TEST` flag could only spawn in a launch that
  ALSO started a session: every env-gated autotest was silently unreachable in a solo launch,
  **including two that document themselves as SP-solo** (`autotest_menutravel_probe`,
  `autotest_ragdoll_spawn_probe`), and the scenario reported `INCONCLUSIVE` — indistinguishable from a
  broken feature. Hoisted in `f2c7e67b`. (b) The death instrument launched SESSIONLESS *on purpose* so
  `net_pump`'s flee could not pre-empt the chain — while the design it graded turns on a veto whose
  first term is a LIVE SESSION, so its arms could never reach the thing they graded. Two configs that
  exclude each other need TWO RUNS, and the instrument must say which it is in (`sessionRunning=0/1`).
  *Look FIRST:* when a run reports INCONCLUSIVE, prove it RAN before debugging the subject — one
  "armed" line at the spawn point is the cheapest discriminator.
  `memory/lesson-an-env-gated-test-can-be-unreachable-by-its-own-launcher.md`

- **AN ASSERTED LIMITATION IS A CLAIM — TEST IT BEFORE DESIGNING AROUND IT.** 2026-08-31, twice in
  one session, opposite subject matter, same shape. (1) `docs/RELEASE.md` step 6 said
  "`COOP_LATEST_*` is stable-only", so I wrote up a real product gap — a dev release cannot use the
  in-game update notice, so the cohort we cut off gets told "update Multivoid" and pointed nowhere —
  and offered the user a fork. The user's *"maybe we can cheat and set coop latest to the dev
  release"* sent me to the code, where there is **no constraint at all**: `[V]`
  `session_manager.cpp:334-347` compares `info.proto` to `kProtocolVersion` and nothing else, and
  `[V]` b133 carries the identical branch. "Stable-only" was a **convention of our own checklist**,
  whose stated reason (dev builds should not nag stable users) *inverts* when a dev release is what
  retires a cohort. (2) `sig_gate --remote` failed `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` and I wrote "TLS
  fails on this dev box" into the release doc — then `verify_latest.ps1` reached the same host over
  TLS fine. Same store, different consumer: OpenSSL walks into an expired cross-signed
  `ISRG Root X2`, schannel finds the valid path. A one-script `--cafile`, not a machine repair.
  *Look FIRST:* ask **where the constraint LIVES** — a branch/type/API that refuses, or prose we
  wrote? Only the first is a constraint. And **a failure blamed on "the environment" needs a SECOND
  CLIENT** before you believe it; one tool failing is a claim about that tool. The tell for (1) is a
  rule stated with its own rationale in parentheses — when the rationale stops applying, check
  whether the rule was ever more than the rationale.
  [[lesson-an-asserted-limitation-is-a-claim-test-it-before-designing-around-it]]

- **A MET PRECONDITION IS NOT THE DECISION IT GATES.** 2026-08-31. The Boosty buttons were pulled
  on the user's call, with the restore condition recorded in the imperative ("restore = revert
  `7ebc2554`, once the page is ready"). The user wrote *"Boosty я настроил"*; I verified the page
  live (HTTP 200) and reverted. Answer: **"No dont restore,"** — undone in `c18003aa`. The fact was
  right and the checklist did say restore; what was wrong is that **"the blocker is gone" and "do
  it" are two different events, and only the second was theirs to signal.** A status report about
  their own work ("I set it up") is not an instruction. The note I had written recorded the
  CONDITION, not the CONSENT — a reminder not to forget, never a standing authorisation that fires
  by itself. *Look FIRST:* when a doc says "do X once Y is true" and Y becomes true, **ask if X is
  outward-facing** (a support rail, a published page, anything strangers see) — one line beats a
  revert pair. This does NOT loosen the standing act-autonomously rule; the boundary is
  outward-facing, not internal. Also: split a pulled feature into its reversible half (Thunderstore's
  `donation_link` is a website setting, changeable any time) and its one-shot half (a badge inside an
  immutable published version) — only the second needs deciding up front.

- **A DETECTOR WHOSE COMPLIANT FORM CARRIES ITS OWN VOCABULARY COUNTS COMPLIANCE AS DEBT** (2026-09-02, three times in one day: a `CORRECTED` grep would have counted the prescribed "(corrected <date>: ...)" note; of five accretion sites in `CLAUDE.md` only two hit the first legacy list because the compliant rewrite and the debt were the SAME string; a `--grep=documentize` census counted the arc doc's own commits). *Look FIRST:* make the compliant form a machine-distinct TOKEN and count everything not in that form; exclude the artifact under audit and every doc that quotes the vocabulary, with a marker. [[lesson-a-detector-whose-compliant-form-carries-its-own-vocabulary-counts-compliance-as-debt]]
- **A MANDATE NOTHING OBSERVES IS SATISFIED BY ASSERTION -- AND SO IS A FIX WRITTEN IN PROSE** (2026-09-02: `/documentize` orders a hand check of 11,291 status hits and a 17.4 MB read per run at 8 closes a day; 148 of 281 commit bodies say "reconciled"; the two steps with a mechanical check held; then the fix's own drafts relied on assertion three times -- paste the trailer, paste the verdict table, key a gate on a word). *Look FIRST:* every rule = a computed SET + a recorded NUMBER, machine-written (a script owns the commit) and machine-read (CI from a registered boundary, keyed on a prefix only the script writes). If any part is "the agent", it is prose. [[lesson-a-mandate-nothing-observes-is-satisfied-by-assertion-and-so-is-a-fix-written-in-prose]]
- **A THREAD FILE THAT KEEPS THE AUDITOR'S WORDS AS THE AUDITED PARTY'S PARAPHRASE MEASURES THE AUDITED PARTY** (2026-09-02: 64 `/qf` thread files held the primary's titles of the critic's questions plus the primary's answers -- 341 of 850 `Q` records contain a question mark -- so "87 of 850 cite a file:line" measured the primary and the critic's rate was unmeasurable; after verbatim persistence the first real pass measured 20 of 20 anchors verified). *Look FIRST:* before measuring a second party, check its words are on disk verbatim under a heading naming the party. [[lesson-a-thread-file-that-keeps-the-auditors-words-as-the-audited-partys-paraphrase-measures-the-audited-party]]
- **STATUS ROT LIVES UNDER TRUE LABELS AND IN UNSTAMPED POINT-IN-TIME DOCS** (2026-09-02, a 28-label sample checked against code and git: 4 of 8 true OPEN labels stale, all 2026-06/07 material never re-stamped; 0 of 12 DONE labels false; 8 of 28 lines rotted in a SUBORDINATE fact -- a line number, a count, a hash, "(commit pending)" -- carrying no status word; 29 % of the status-regex hits were not labels). *Look FIRST:* read the clause beside the label and the citations under it, and prioritise month-old point-in-time docs; a label grammar beats the raw regex several-fold, and `[V]`/`[A]`/`[RD]` are provenance, not status.

## 2. Join-window identity & the DUP-prone zone (measure before touching)

- **A WINDOW CLOSED BY THE LATCH THAT STARTS THE NEXT PHASE ENDS BEFORE THAT PHASE — BY
  CONSTRUCTION.** Measured 2026-08-23 (R-4a-end, 9-round /qf): the world-load episode's destroy
  suppression lowered on the quiescence latch, the quiescence latch is what permits the
  ClientWorldReady announce, and the host's bracket starts only after the announce — so the
  suppression ALWAYS ended before the join reconcile it existed to cover (field: 1,629 junk
  broadcasts 23 s after "episode CLOSED"; a fast box masks it entirely). *Look FIRST:* any gate
  whose CLOSE edge doubles as the TRIGGER of the work it guards — ask "what does this latch
  START, and must my window span that too?" Fix shape (a second, kind-classified window spanning
  the triggered phase): `world_load_episode` reconcile window +

- **A ZERO FROM AN ACCESSOR MEANS "NOT IN MY HALF", NOT "DOES NOT EXIST" — and that wrong root
  survived ~47 `/qf` rounds because it predicted the symptom perfectly.** 2026-08-25. `[MEASURED]`
  Four sessions carried *"a v122 client mints no Element row for its own save-loaded keyed prop, so the
  eid is 0"* into a design doc, a header, a protocol comment and a commit message. The client HAD the
  row: `CLIENT_1 …:18589` `CreateOrAdoptPropMirror: eid=4196 bound to actor=…0x…1C80
  key='xTy31ERNFExrbjG1NzOkVg'`, six minutes before `…:35483` broadcast that same actor with `eid=0`.
  The 0 comes from `prop_element_tracker.cpp:457-469`, which re-imposes a **LOCALS-ONLY contract** —
  `if (!el || el->IsMirror()) return kInvalidId;` — and names its own twin in the same comment
  (`ResolveMirrorEidByActor`, `remote_prop.h:110`), which would have returned 4196. Two things outlived
  the wrong root: the eid was documented as "unreachable, riding in alignment padding" when it is the
  HOST's own number and obtainable, and the fix resolves **key-first** while the sibling `PropDestroy`
  receiver resolves **eid-first** with an MTA `Packet_EntityRemove` citation saying so in capitals
  (`remote_prop_destroy.cpp:129-146`).
  **LOOK HERE FIRST:** `kInvalidId` and "no row" are the same value — before writing "X has no id",
  open the accessor that returned it and read its CONTRACT; nearly every reverse index in this tree is
  halved (locals/mirrors, host band/peer band, keyed/keyless) and a zero from one half says nothing
  about the other. Grep the log for the IDENTITY (the actor pointer, the key), not only for the
  failure line. And when citing a sibling lane as precedent, read its resolve ORDER, not just which
  primitive it calls.

- **ON A v122 CLIENT THE ELEMENT REGISTRY HOLDS ONLY HOST-BOUND MIRRORS — "local props" must be
  selected by keyed-interactable + NO element bound.** Measured 2026-08-23 (the R-4a-end drill's
  RED run): `Registry::SnapshotActorsByType(Prop)` on a client picked five pile MIRRORS whose
  destruction the mirror layer healed without touching the seam's broadcast path (RED read 1/5).
  The delivery side mirrors the asymmetry: `ExpressIncrementalSpawn`/`DeliverLateRegisteredProps`
  are HOST-only (prop_snapshot.cpp:620/:642) — a client's suppressed place has NO census
  delivery channel. *Look FIRST:* any client-side census/drill needing locals —
  `IsKeyedInteractable(obj) && GetPropElementIdForActor(obj)==kInvalidId`, never the Registry.
  `memory/lesson_v122_client_registry_holds_only_mirrors.md`

- **Row field vs per-slot state: does it describe the PERSON or the LINK?** The arc-A design put the
  `joinSent` latch in the roster ledger's row beside nick/guid/skin. It cannot live there: a CLIENT
  sends its Join to slot 0 BEFORE the host's Join arrives, so row 0 does not exist yet, the
  occupancy-gated setter drops the write SILENTLY (which is correct for every identity field), and
  the client re-sends its Join on all 125 ticks per second forever. The tell is direction: an
  OUTBOUND fact ("we did something to that slot") is link-scoped and exists before anyone is
  identified; an INBOUND one ("that peer told us who they are") is person-scoped. Link-scoped state
  still needs replacement-clearing, so it goes in `PerSlotState<T>` (which registers its own clear in
  its constructor), never a bare array. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_link_scoped_state_cannot_live_in_a_person_row.md`

- **A recycled slot's replacement carries no ABSENCE — detect occupancy, don't observe departure** —
  slots are handed out lowest-free (`session_status.cpp:87-93`) and the close/accept pair runs on the
  NET thread, so a slot can go occupant X -> occupant Y with no empty state between and the polled
  falling `IsSlotReady` edge (`event_feed.cpp:127-135`) can miss BOTH transitions inside one 8 ms GT
  tick — routine on loopback, i.e. our own 2-peers-on-one-machine rig. Cure: an occupancy TOKEN read
  as current state (host-minted generation internally, session-monotonic `playerNo` on the wire) plus
  a periodic reconcile as its executor, since after a departure with no successor no packet arrives to
  trigger a "check at use". *Look FIRST:*

  `memory/lesson_recycled_slot_replacement_carries_no_absence.md`
- **Validate WHERE YOU READ, not against a mirror — or staleness fails OPEN** — a destructive action
  that re-checks its captured token against the game-thread MIRROR only narrows its race: the net
  thread can clear a slot and accept a successor before the GT runs, so the stale mirror still holds
  the predecessor's token, the check passes, and the address is resolved from the LIVE connection.
  Take a value FROM the mirror and compare it against the AUTHORITY you are about to read, atomically
  with that read ("resolve this slot's address IFF its generation is still G") — then staleness fails
  CLOSED. Put the token in the API SIGNATURE so a tokenless call cannot compile; a hand-listed call
  set is not a defence (a manual census missed `scoreboard.cpp:285`; a mechanical grep found eight
  `moderation::` sites, six slot-addressed). Measured instance: `BanSlot` uses a slot captured when
  the modal OPENED, across an arbitrary typing delay -> a permanent IP ban can hit the successor.

  worked host-side ONLY via the mirror-stack + reverse-steal (the fuzzy path even REKEYED the host's
  actor to the client's key before any bind); a bare reject would have silently re-broken it. Closing
  a hole and keeping every flow that leaned on the hole are two separate obligations (v122 H handback
  = enroll + re-express replaces the stolen function). *Look FIRST:* remote_prop_spawn.cpp

- **A client grab/drop of a host-owned keyed prop = a MOVE with TWO same-key halves** (SPAWN author + a
  co-fired grab-hook DESTROY); the DESTROY is usually the killer. *Look FIRST:* the destroy-seam, not the
  spawn author. `memory/lesson_client_keyed_prop_move_two_wire_halves.md`

- **REUSE the proven author (with its gates), don't raw-reimplement** — a raw MarkPropElement broke the
  E-grab decline. **Extended 2026-07-27:** the same question applies to PRIMITIVES across lanes — a
  UTF-8 nickname codec was derived from scratch for three `/qf` rounds before a grep found the CHAT lane
  had shipped it on 2026-07-04 (`chat_sync.cpp` `SanitizeUtf8`/`NickUtf8` with surrogate handling/
  `TrimAndCap` with character-boundary back-off), with TWO copies already in the tree. Grep the sibling
  lanes that carry the same payload kind before designing. **Ending, 2026-07-28 (`6e1156da`): the two
  copies were STILL COMPILED four days after `coop/text/utf8_codec` was promoted, and had DIVERGED —
  both emitted CESU-8 for an unpaired surrogate where the owner drops it, so ill-formed UTF-8 could
  reach the chat wire. Worse, the codec header ASSERTED they had been absorbed. Promoting an owner is
  half the job; the other half is deleting the copies and making the header's claim true.**

- **Check the EXISTING barrier's ANCHOR before building compensation layers** — the two-authority
  join seam (4 roots, 4 layers, 3 days) was ONE mis-anchored edge: the v56 gate/replay WAS the MTA
  join barrier, but ClientWorldReady fired at "world up" (seconds before the loadObjects tail
  settled). *Look FIRST* on a window/race class's SECOND compensation layer: does a READY edge
  exist, what PREDICATE fires it ("world up" != "world settled"), is a stronger client-local
  signal already trusted elsewhere (the doom sweep's probe was). Moving an edge beats compensating
  for it. `memory/lesson_check_existing_barrier_anchor_before_compensating.md`
- **Harness TimelineThread call sites: an Arm() stays ATOMICS-ONLY (or Post to the GT)** —
  DriveMenuModeJoinWorldBoot runs OFF the game thread (harness/session_runtime.cpp:253, s27 cut); extending a directly-
  called Arm to touch plain GT-owned state is a silent data race (2026-07-12 audit CRITICAL: 8
  fields + a std::string; fixed `7847021e` via an atomic request flag consumed by the GT ticker +
  UE_ASSERT_GAME_THREAD on GT-only entries). *Look FIRST:* the caller's thread — grep the enclosing
  harness function for TimelineThread comments / Post-and-wait siblings.

- **In-episode wire expressions WERE provisional — the JOIN BARRIER removed the window (2026-07-12
  `bbf91f39`, SUPERSEDED AT SOURCE):** ClientWorldReady now announces at load-tail quiescence
  (`coop/session/world_load_episode` probe latch — the MTA INITIAL_DATA_STREAM shape), so no wire
  prop expression can arrive mid-churn; the capture/revalidation/netting machinery (takes 1-4) was
  RULE-2 deleted. The measured record (fresh mirrors churn-killed ~2 s; converge targets recreated
  only from save-WORLD records; phase replay inverting a destroy->spawn pair; doom judges LAST)
  stays the FIRST read for a prop bug in the DEGRADED mode ("latching DEGRADED" in the client log)
  or the TRAVEL window (no travel-start gate yet). *Look FIRST:* client log — "load-tail QUIESCED"
  must precede "ClientWorldReady announced"; NO [SPAWN-DEFER] lines exist anymore (one appearing =
  someone resurrected the dead machinery); per-doom cls/key/loc lines + the dead-row tripwire still
  live in the sweep. `memory/lesson_join_window_wire_expression_provisional.md`
- **VOTV's OWN save ships DUPLICATE interactable Keys** (85 trashBitsPile_C across 4 keys — save-born
  clone families; the 06-24 sweep silently doomed "80 trashBitsPile" for weeks). Key uniqueness is OUR
  invariant: the HOST re-keys duplicates at enroll (MarkPropElement, the one owner; GT-gated setKey;
  dead incumbent = churn recreate inheriting identity). Take-4: the `2fefd161` re-key was INERT (162x
  "setKey not found" — trashBitsPile is actor_save_C lineage; repaired by the SuperStruct-climbing
  resolver, `460da7e4`). *Look FIRST:* host-log "KEY-UNIQUENESS ... re-keyed -> 'rk_'" SUCCESS burst
  ("re-key FAILED" = the authority is NOT working); same-key multiplicity histogram in the adopt burst.

- **MirrorManager\<Prop\> MIXES census LOCAL rows with wire rows (one actor can carry BOTH)** — an
  actor->eid reverse meaning "established cross-peer identity" must filter `IsMirror()`
  (`ResolveMirrorEidByActor(wireMirrorOnly)`), else it kills the Gap-I-1 divergent-key dedup.

- **A NEW generic catch/express lane must inherit EVERY existing owner boundary; "UNTRACKED = mine"
  premises die when per-tick claimers ship** — spawn_authority Inc-1's seam drain (07-10) lacked the
  kerfur OWNER BOUNDARY the census lane already carried → the 5 Hz kerfur converge lost every race,
  silently released the dead NPC, no KerfurConvert → the take-8 five-for-five toggle dupe. Fix = kerfur
  FIRST REFUSAL at the express chokepoints (TryAdoptFreshKerfurProp: UNTRACKED + dead-NPC-watch match,
  event-driven at the spawn edge; the poll stays as backstop), `ded3f793`. *Look FIRST:* a poll-class
  "converge found nothing" WARN right after a `spawn-seam adopted`/generic express of the same
  class+position = the race; when adding a lane, DIFF its gates against every sibling lane.

- **ChildActorComponent children are OUTSIDE the world-object universe** — a kerfur eye cam
  (prop_camera_good_C) passes every "world prop" filter (keyed, Aprop lineage, live) but the game's
  own rule is `Aprop_C::ignoreSave = ignoreSav || IsChildActor()` (prop_base bytecode): its Key is
  per-peer random, cross-peer identity impossible in principle. Enrolling/broadcasting them = floating
  CCTV mirrors on the joiner + the joiner's own eye cams doomed (take-7). And a SEND-side exclusion
  must gate EVERY payload builder — the steady re-seed express bypassed enrollment (elementId=0 keyed
  payloads) while the gated destroy seam made its orphans PERMANENT (audit CRITICAL). *Look FIRST:*
  `ue_wrap::engine::IsChildActor` (six consult surfaces, `c93617be`); any NEW prop enumeration must
  consult it. `memory/lesson_child_actors_excluded_from_world_object_universe.md`
- **A module's "I am the ONE owner" is an INTENT; the callers are the fact.** Measured 2026-07-29:
  `coop/text/utf8_codec.h:1` opens *"ARC D1: the ONE owner of text encoding"* and `:18-21` states the
  receive boundary *"decodes STRICTLY and rejects a whole ill-formed field"* — and both sentences had
  been copied forward into `CLAUDE.md` and `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md:83` as settled architecture. Against HEAD:
  `chat_sync.cpp:32` defined its **own** byte-identical `SanitizeUtf8`, `:45` re-implemented
  `CapUtf8Bytes`, and `:114-124` `OnReliable` did **no decode at all**, pushing raw wire bytes to TWO
  render surfaces — in a file whose line 5 includes the owner. The claim held on the NICK path and was
  false on **chat, the one attacker-controlled string in the process** (`docs/security/TRACKER.md`
  **W11**, fixed `84e0a4e3`). *Look FIRST:* a sole-ownership claim is a hypothesis about the CALLERS —
  `grep -rn "<FunctionName>" src/` for definitions outside the owner, and check that each includer
  actually CALLS it. **An anonymous-namespace function with the same name as a public one is a silent
  override** — no warning, no link error. And a doc quoting another doc inherits nothing: three files
  agreeing is one measurement copied twice. Corollary from the same dig: **"validated" is not one
  property** — the tracker's own "every wire string clamps length" was accurate and was read as "wire
  strings are validated"; length-clamped is not well-formed.
  `memory/lesson_a_sole_ownership_claim_is_a_claim.md`
- **Before replicating a store, census what is IN it — and ask whether it is a RECORD or a VIEW.**
  Measured 2026-07-29: a 21-round `/qf` designed "seed the late joiner with the host's chat history" for
  eighteen rounds before anyone ran `grep -rn "chat_feed::Push("`. It returns **15 sites**, including the
  local player's own first-person UI notices — `nick_color.cpp:92` *"Nickname color: applied"*,
  `local_body.cpp:83` *"Skin: X"*, `player_handshake.cpp:469` *"Connecting to X's game..."* — plus two
  `[1c-test]` debug lines, with **no field distinguishing them from typed chat**. Seeding the host's
  retained set would have shipped the host's own UI confirmations to a joiner as "the lobby's history".
  And the host's set is the host's **VIEW**, bounded by its own cap, TTL and `Reset` — so the lobby's
  history **did not exist anywhere** and has to be CREATED (a host-owned canonical log, local feed
  demoted to a view of it; the MTA shape). *Look FIRST:* the store's NAME is the trap — run the census on
  its WRITE API before designing replication, and ask "is this a record or a view?" A store with a cap,
  a TTL or a reset that exists for DISPLAY reasons is a view, and replicating a view propagates one
  peer's rendering policy as shared truth. A single write API with several semantic kinds inside it is a
  DEFERRED discriminator decision, and the bill arrives the first time something wants a subset.
  `memory/lesson_census_what_is_in_a_store_before_replicating_it.md`
- **Identity-critical log lines carry cls+key+loc (USER RULE)** — a class histogram alone makes
  per-entity RCA impossible; cold paths only, never at the POST-native destroy seam (PendingKill),
  throttle mass arms. `memory/feedback_identity_logs_carry_key_and_loc.md`

- **A display PLACEHOLDER must never be stored where identity is read.** Measured 2026-07-28 (arc B):
  the host installs a roster row when a slot reaches READY, which is BEFORE that peer's Join carries its
  name — so the first row about a joiner legitimately has an empty nick. `SanitizeNickname("")` minted
  the display fallback `"Player"` and stored it as a name; the joiner then ADOPTED it as canonical and,
  under the persist decision, wrote it over the human's real name permanently
  (`nick: host renamed us 'Client1' -> 'Player'`). The placeholder had been correct for years — the bug
  was created by a NEW READER, in a file that was not edited, and is invisible in the diff. *Look FIRST:*
  before promoting any displayed value to an identity, ask "what is this when it is not known yet, and
  does that sentinel round-trip?"; keep the fallback at the LAST layer (the renderer), one copy, never in
  the store. `memory/lesson_a_placeholder_must_never_become_an_identity.md`
- **Census the DIRECTION, not only the operation — a widen census is blind to a narrow.** Measured
  2026-07-28 (arc D1): the design censused per-byte WIDENS and found 7 sites; fixing all seven changed
  NOTHING VISIBLE, because two sites in front of them were NARROWS — `harness.cpp` replacing non-ASCII
  with `'?'`, and `ReadEnv` using `GetEnvironmentVariableA` (Windows holds the environment as UTF-16; the
  A-variant converts down to the ANSI codepage, so a Cyrillic env var arrived as cp1251 and the correct
  new strict decoder produced a row of U+FFFD). The debugging trap is the worse half: because the
  destroyer was UPSTREAM, each correct fix produced no visible change — the exact signature of "my fix is
  wrong". *Look FIRST:* census both directions AND every Win32 `...A`/`...W` pair on the path; and when a
  correct fix changes nothing, log the value at the seam you are about to trust instead of reading
  further. Third instance of `lesson_census_the_operation_kind_not_only_the_sites`, which it sharpens.
  **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-29, a GATE rather than a conversion, and it survived a 17-round `/qf`:** a
  chat design put `ChatLine` into `IsPreWorldSendableKind` to stop a client's own line vanishing in its
  load window. That gate is the HOST's send gate toward a JOINING SLOT; a client's send toward slot 0 is
  never gated (`ClientConnectEdge` marks it ready immediately, and says so in its own comment), so the
  hole did not exist — and applying the fix would have MANUFACTURED one by letting live rows land in
  front of the join seed. *Look FIRST: before "fixing" a silent drop, confirm which SIDE the gate
  guards; a gate named for a STAGE ("pre-world") rarely says which DIRECTION it faces.*
  **THIRD INSTANCE 2026-07-29, the census of a FUNCTION'S OTHER WRITES:** `chat_input.cpp:62` carries a
  comment that IS a census — "Open/Close are reached from THREE threads … so the store is told through
  `SetChatOpen`, which writes atomics only" — every word true, while the very next lines of `Open()` and
  `Close()` also write `g_buf[0]` and `g_histPos`, both declared **render-thread only** at `:22`/`:29-32`,
  from the WndProc, while `InputTextWithHint` may be mid-frame. The census asked "what do these tell the
  STORE?" and never "what ELSE do these WRITE?". *Look FIRST: a census scoped to one DESTINATION reads as
  a census of the function — enumerate every write target, not every caller.*
  `memory/lesson_census_the_direction_not_only_the_operation.md`
- **READ THE PAYLOAD'S COMMENT, NOT ONLY ITS FIELDS.** 2026-08-29, ATV design pass.
  `protocol.h:4086-4090`'s comment on `AtvStatePayload` says verbatim *"idle ones stay physics-on +
  grabbable"*. I opened that struct in `/qf` round 1 **for its field list**, and "discovered" that same
  fact in round 8 as a finding that reversed a design decision. A wire struct's field list answers
  "what is on the wire"; its comment answers **"what the peers DO with it"**, which is the question a
  sync design is actually asking, and it is often the only written statement of that invariant.
  *Look FIRST: when you open a struct for its fields, read its comment for its CLAIMS in the same
  pass and write them beside the field list; if your forming design contradicts one, that is a round-1
  finding.* Bounded by `[[lesson-a-cannot-in-a-comment-is-a-snapshot-of-what-was-tried]]` (the claim may itself be false -- read it,
  then verify it). `memory/lesson_read_the_payloads_comment_not_only_its_fields.md`
- **A LESSON'S POINTER ROTS INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS TAKEAWAY.** 2026-08-29. This ledger's
  `bSimulatePhysics` row ended *"Read a bitfield via `FindBoolFieldBits` (`reflection.h:277-290`)"* --
  `[V]` that symbol exists **nowhere in the tree**; the real one is `FindBoolProperty`
  (`reflection.h:299`), and those lines are `EnumerateStructFields`. The takeaway was still correct;
  only the pointer had died. It was found **by accident**, because a design argument happened to cite
  the row. A takeaway is a statement about the engine (stable); a pointer is a statement about OUR
  tree (moves weekly), and the DIG-RULE makes the next session TRUST the pointer instead of searching
  -- so a dead one is a WORSE dig than no lesson. *Look FIRST: build a `lessons_gate` that greps every
  backticked identifier and `file.h:NNN` in this file against the tree (the pattern exists:
  `registry_gate.ps1`, `nick_gate.ps1`, `minhook_free_gate.ps1`). Until it exists, grep a lesson's
  symbol at the moment you CITE it -- that is when the rot becomes load-bearing.*
  `memory/lesson_a_lessons_pointer_rots_independently_of_its_takeaway.md`
- **PRIOR ART TRANSFERS ONLY WITH ITS PREMISE.** 2026-08-29. MTA's vehicle model was adopted, then
  rejected, then re-opened inside one pass -- each time on an unmeasured premise about OUR world.
  `[V]` MTA keeps remote vehicles simulating (`ReadVehiclePuresync`, `UpdateTargetPosition:3867-3907`);
  `[V]` our prop mirrors are kinematic (`native_pile_mirror.cpp:70`), which seemed to kill the
  transfer; `[V]` but `atv_sync.cpp` calls `ReleaseMirror` at `:448`/`:489`/`:635`/`:661`, so the ATV
  mirror **already simulates** whenever idle or released. The precedent's authority attaches to the
  MECHANISM and silently carries to the PRECONDITION, which is a fact about our tree, not part of the
  precedent. *Look FIRST: after grepping the MTA equivalent of your PROBLEM, write down the
  precondition its answer needs and grep OUR tree for it before concluding either way -- and if the
  precondition is "this project always does X", enumerate the instances, because the exception is
  usually the entity you are designing for.* `memory/lesson_prior_art_transfers_only_with_its_premise.md`
- **PARK THE BRAIN; DO NOT REPLACE THE ENGINE ENTITY.** 2026-08-29, the thesis of the new crutch
  register (`docs/CRUTCHES.md`). Both opening entries are the same move: the ATV mirror **freezes**
  the engine entity (killing the constraint rig's suspension, and its tick-only steering and torque);
  the trash clump mirror **replaces** it with a bare `AStaticMeshActor`. In both cases the obstacle
  was ONE property -- actor tick, and `AddToRoot` (`[V]` the 2026-06-30 probe proved the clump
  mirror's death was GC, not the blueprint). The diagnostic signature is **a crutch that needs a
  crutch**: the fake actor *"can never be lookAtActor"*, so a parallel camera-ray-cone aim system was
  built, and it is still in the tree. *Look FIRST: when a mirrored engine entity misbehaves, ask WHICH
  BRAIN DO I PARK (tick / bound delegates / LifeSpan / timers / GC-rooting), never "how do I stop
  being the engine entity". Principle 3 is the test. And when a probe later proves the obstacle was
  one property, RULE 2 retires the workaround WHOLE, not for the convenient half -- two mirror
  implementations for one concept compile together today.*

## 3. Sync architecture (owners, routers, lifecycle)

- **A GNS CLOSE REASON IS THE PEER'S OWN STRING, AND `'session stop'` NARROWS TO A DELIBERATE HUMAN ACT — a crash CANNOT produce it.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, the whole field-join diagnosis turned on this census. `session_status.cpp:581` logs `cb->m_info.m_szEndDebug`, which on a `ClosedByPeer` transition is supplied BY THE REMOTE; the only producer of the literal `"session stop"` in the tree is `session_start.cpp:476` inside `Session::Stop()`; and `Session::Stop()` has exactly FOUR call sites. Excluding `FleeToMainMenu`'s four callers (the menu-guard needs `g_everInGameplayThisSession`, which a menu-mode joiner never sets), both cover timeouts (120 s / 240 s), the `SnapshotEnd`→`Complete()` route, and every `Fail()` site, what remains for a joiner mid-transfer is: the **Cancel button** (`loading_screen.cpp:131` — `RequestCancel()`'s ONE caller, no ESC binding) or **closing the window** (`shutdown.cpp:85-91` → `DoShutdown()` → `Stop()`). **`DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` is PERSIST-ONLY** and `dllmain.cpp:28-31` says why in its own words: *"DoShutdown runs only from CoopWndProc's close branch: the game's own quit (RequestExit -> FEngineLoop::Exit) never reaches it"* — so neither a crash nor a normal in-game quit emits this reason. **Look here FIRST:** when a host log shows a peer leaving, read the reason string as EVIDENCE ABOUT THE PEER'S CODE PATH, not as a generic disconnect — census the producers of that exact literal before theorising, because the set is usually tiny and it converts "they were refused" into a measured statement about what a human did. [[lesson-a-close-reason-is-the-peers-string-and-session-stop-means-a-human-acted]]

- **VALIDATE A TRANSFERRED BLOB AGAINST A COMPARATOR, NOT AGAINST NON-EMPTINESS.** `[V]` 2026-09-01, from a user's host log: `streaming LIVE host world (16894622 bytes, 295 chunks)` on one hosting and `(1284 bytes, 1 chunk)` on the next, where a client joined the instant the lobby appeared. The joiner took 1284 bytes as the host's world, loaded nothing, and kept its own -- two ATVs, every door disagreeing, while both peers saw each other normally. The world was NOT missing (the same capture recorded 2,197 live keyed props); the SAVE had not finished being written, and the code asserted `"no torn-read window -- we just wrote it"` while checking only `!bytes.empty()`. The same file already polls for size+mtime stability on its OTHER path (`TryCaptureBlob_`); only the live capture was exempt. **Look here FIRST:** a payload standing for a whole subsystem's state needs something to be commensurate WITH -- here the host's own canonical `.sav`, which it loaded the world from, so a live capture cannot be an eighth of its size and a new game is small on both sides. If one path in a file has a stability guard and another does not, the exempt one is the bug; fail over to the guarded path rather than inventing a refusal. [[lesson-validate-a-transferred-blob-against-a-comparator]]

- **ONE VARIABLE DOING TWO JOBS FORCES THE FIX TO BE DESTRUCTIVE.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `local_body`'s `g_skin` was both the player's CHOICE (persisted to the ini, announced on the wire, restored at boot -- `player_skin` is `CFG_IDENTITY`) and the body's WORN skin. So the only way to degrade the body was to overwrite the choice, which persisted a fallback and broadcast it -- and `ApplySkinToBody` returns false for at least two DOCUMENTED-TRANSIENT reasons, so an atlas texture that had not finished loading in the join window deleted a saved skin permanently and took it off every peer that COULD render it. Splitting them removed the ini write, the re-announce and a retry storm together: the choice is untouchable, the worn body is derived each tick. **Look here FIRST:** when a fix has to overwrite a stored preference in order to change runtime behaviour, that is the tell -- split before fixing, keep the AUTHORED value and DERIVE the effective one. And ask what the failure PROVES: "the apply returned false" is not "the asset does not exist". [[lesson-one-variable-doing-two-jobs-forces-a-destructive-fix]]

- **A MODE THAT NAMES TWO THINGS BREAKS AT ITS SECOND CONSUMER -- and null-guarding the hooks does not bound it.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `Channel::Mode::HostAuth` meant both "the host is authoritative" and "this feature uses the DOOR HOLD REGISTER", and the register was not hook-gated -- `holdOpen_[key] |= bit` and `settling_[key] = ...` ran whether or not an adapter supplied the hold hooks, while the poll SKIPS every key present in `holdOpen_`. So the second HostAuth feature ever written would have entered the door bookkeeping on its first client request and silently stopped being polled. It read as correct for months because it had exactly one consumer, which makes "the axis" and "that feature's machinery" indistinguishable. **Look here FIRST:** before adding the second consumer of a mode in shared code, census EVERY branch that reads it (not the one that grepped for the symbol you had in mind) and ask of each whether it is about the axis or about the incumbent; the tell is bookkeeping OUTSIDE a hook's null check; split it with an explicit per-adapter flag so the incumbent declares what it had implicitly. [[lesson-a-mode-that-names-two-things-breaks-at-its-second-consumer]]

- **A HANDSHAKE'S ORDER IS A MEASUREMENT; A KIND'S NAME IS NOT EVIDENCE OF IT.** 2026-08-26. Building
  the admission gate I made the test "admit when the peer sends a `Join`" -- the message named after
  joining. `[V]` It DEADLOCKED every honest join, and the host log diagnosed it in one line:
  `"PENDING 0 sent kind=42 before admission -- dropped"`. `[V]` Kind 42 is `SaveTransferRequest`, and
  `protocol.h:1798` says exactly what it is: *"a MENU-MODE joining client asks the host for"* the save.
  **A joining client has no world yet** -- it sits in the main menu and must fetch and LOAD the host's
  save before it can announce itself, so `Join` is near the END of joining, not the start. Measured
  order: connect -> `SaveTransferRequest`(42) -> chunks -> `ClientWorldReady`(45) -> `Join`(1). **This
  reframed a security finding, not just a bug:** TRACKER A57 said a stranger pulls the whole world
  *"without ever sending Join"*, which framed the save as a privilege skipped ahead to; the measurement
  says it is the first thing EVERY client asks for, so `PLAN_04` s1's *"before world access"* means
  before the **SAVE**, and a gate at `Join` is not merely late but structurally incapable. The doc was
  precise; my reading mapped it onto the wrong message because I inferred order from a name. *Look
  FIRST:* log one run's inbound kinds in order before gating on "the peer has sent X"; ask what STATE
  the peer is in at that moment (no world) rather than what the message is called; and always log the
  KIND you refused, which is what turned a hang into a one-line diagnosis.
  `memory/lesson_a_handshakes_order_is_measured_not_named.md`

- **Before designing a receiver-side answer to a phenomenon, read the PRODUCER's gate — it may already
  suppress it.** 2026-08-25: A52's design spent four rounds building "forgiveness" rules so a host-side
  movement validator would not punish the join teleport, including a whole source kind
  (`saveSlot.playerTransform`) to cover it. **It was already written down** — `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md:103`
  has carried the "JOIN-JUMP sender gate" row since `614cade8`, in the very doc the reading order names
  for "where does this sync live". Then `net_pump.cpp:765-772` was read: a client emits **no
  poses at all** until `g_worldReadyAnnounced && !g_reAnnounceWorldReady && HasLoadTailQuiesced()`, and
  the gate's own comment says why — *"loadObjects' spawn flux (which contains the player teleport)"*.
  The join teleport **never reaches the wire**, the forgiveness source had no reader, and it was
  deleted. Two true receiver-side facts had pointed the other way and were irrelevant
  (`IsSlotWorldReady` gates sends and relays but not `StoreStreamPacket`; the occupancy generation is
  minted at accept). **Look here FIRST:** when a receiver-side design starts growing exceptions, grep
  who calls the publish function (`SetLocal*`) and what guards that call — this project's gates usually
  carry a comment naming the bug they were built for.
  `memory/lesson_the_producer_may_already_suppress_the_phenomenon.md`


- **When two readiness predicates differ only by a QUALIFIER, the bare one is the WEAKER claim.**
  MEASURED 2026-07-29: `Session::IsSlotReady()` returns `peerLanesConfigured_` (`session.h:397-400`) —
  "GNS lanes are up" — while `IsSlotWorldReady()` returns `slotWorldReady_` (`session.h:305-308`). The
  bare name reads as the general/stronger case and is the opposite: an EARLIER stage a peer satisfies
  ~30-60 s before it has a world. A chat-history design gated a join-seeded broadcast on `IsSlotReady`,
  which would have shipped live rows to a slot before its seed and put the seed UNDERNEATH rows already
  applied — the exact interleave the dedup range exists to prevent, reachable only if someone talks
  during another peer's load window. **Look FIRST: for any predicate gating a JOIN-TIME lane, open it
  and read the FIELD, not the name — the stages here are transport-up → lanes-configured →
  save-transferred → world-ready → replay-sent. And when a lane needs "have I done X for this slot",
  give it its OWN gate rather than borrowing a session predicate that merely correlates today.**

- **A JOIN SEED needs a CONTIGUOUS applied RANGE, never a high-watermark — and the seed must not
  interleave with live traffic.** 2026-07-29 (chat history, AS-BUILT): a seed delivers rows OLDER than
  anything the receiver holds, so `seq > highest` discards the ENTIRE seed, silently. Two halves make
  the range work: the host holds a **per-slot seed gate** (live rows to a slot start only once its seed
  is sent, reopened on slot turnover), and `ChatLine` is deliberately kept OUT of
  `IsPreWorldSendableKind` — together they make the applied set one interval that only grows upward. A
  GAP is logged loudly as the tripwire if either premise changes. **Any future lane whose seed can
  interleave with live traffic inherits this shape** (`docs/COOP_EVENT_JOIN.md` §3.4 chat row).

- **The player inventory is TWO stores, and our lane polls the wrong-shaped one** (2026-07-24, bytecode +
  runtime). LIVE = `UpropInventory_C` → `saveSlot.GObjStack[propInventory.Index]` (what play mutates; the
  player's own inventory IS a container, `Aprop_inventoryContainer_player_C : Aprop_container_C`).
  SAVE-SIDE PROJECTION = `saveSlot.inventoryData`, a *different field* (0x02E0 vs GObjStack 0x0198),
  written by `mainGamemode::saveObjects`. A container slot press = `getObject → addObject →
  K2_DestroyActor` and touches `inventoryData` **zero** times — zero refs across `prop_container`,
  `prop_inventoryContainer_player`, `uicomp_playerInvContainerSlot`, `ui_playerInventory`. Our
  `player_inventory_sync` reads ONLY `inventoryData`/`equipment`/`hold`. On a CLIENT the projection never
  refreshes: `save_block` holds `gamemode.disableSave=true` and `saveSlot_C::save` checks it at op03
  BEFORE `saveObjects` (op12) and `saveToSlot` (op19) — a deliberate 2026-07-04 mandate documented in
  `save_block.h` Part 3. Measured gaps were CONSTANT (client 0-vs-6, host 4-vs-5) = an ORIGIN mismatch,
  not accumulation; and host vs client projections have DIFFERENT AUTHORS (game save/load vs our
  join-apply), so "refresh it more often" cannot be one fix for both. *Look FIRST:*
  `research/findings/inventory-items/votv-player-inventory-two-layer-RE-2026-07-24.md` + its scope brief.
  `memory/lesson_player_inventory_is_two_layers_live_and_projection.md`
- **A probe's side effects travel through OUR OWN lanes, not just the engine's** (2026-07-24). A dev probe
  called `mainGamemode::saveObjects` and was declared read-only because it skips
  `saveToSlot`/`SaveGameToSlot` — true about the engine's disk path, false about the system: the refresh
  changed `inventoryData`, `player_inventory_sync` polls that at ~1 Hz and ships on a HASH CHANGE, the host
  persisted it, and `coop_players/<guid>.json` went 2204 → 4848 bytes holding a state no organic run
  produces (restored from `.bak`; the next run would otherwise have started from an impossible state).
  *Look FIRST:* before a probe calls a game verb, census EVERY consumer of the state that verb touches —
  grep our own lanes for polls/hooks on those fields — not only the engine path you deliberately avoided.
  Any change-detecting poll downstream means the probe is not read-only.
  `memory/lesson_probe_side_effects_travel_through_our_own_lanes.md`

- **One cache per QUESTION, not per write-moment** — a hash/state map written at ONE instant but read to
  answer TWO questions is a latent bug: the answers diverge the moment the peer mutates locally, and
  nothing about the WRITE reveals it (same line, same value; only the reads differ). The R11b container
  lane needed **four** maps and each collapse produced a different LIVE failure, one per smoke:
  `published` fused into `sent` → the targeted connect seed recorded nothing, so the host **refused every
  client write after a join**; `base` fused into `applied` → clearing on a local edit (right for the
  no-op gate) made the peer **declare base 0** and be refused again, while NOT clearing made the host's
  corrective re-publish hash identically to the pre-edit blob and get skipped, so **a refused peer never
  converged**. **Look here FIRST:** when adding a second reader to an existing cache, ask what event
  makes the two readers want different values — in a sync lane it is almost always the peer's own local
  mutation. Split, and NAME each map after its question.
  `memory/lesson_one_cache_per_question_not_per_write_moment.md`

- **The HOST's Join always reaches the client BEFORE the client's own Join goes out** (the
  client's send waits for its Element allocation post-AssignPeerSlot), so any symmetric per-side
  Join validation fires CLIENT-side first and the host-side branch is a trust-boundary backstop
  only reachable by a peer that skips its own check — role-swapped drills can NOT cover it; use a
  NOVAL drill build (validation compiled out one line, never shipped). Measured s29 drills B/B2/B3

- **Per-UNIT device identity exists ONLY at the AIM seam — 5 of 7 enterable families render ONE
  shared widget instance** (ui_console_C = ALL SAT consoles; gamemode.laptop = base laptop + every
  portable PC), so widget→owning-unit is architecturally underivable at any widget-side surface
  (rising-edge / lost-race denies). Capture the unit's native name at InpActEvt_use PRE
  (ReadMainPlayerLookAtActor) — the s23 busy-notice memo shape; and note the race LOSER (whose own
  E-press wrote the memo ~RTT ago) is who gets force-exited, so the memo is fresh by construction.

- **A claim-gated intent lane must cover EVERY entry surface of the device.** v111 routed desk knob
  intents over the claimed-occupant lane, but the claim engages only on the intComs `activeInterface`
  edge — the download unit's WORLD-SPACE buttons never raise it, so the lane was structurally dead for
  the unit it was built for (bugs 1/2/3 of the 2026-07-16 hands-on = ONE axis fact). *Look FIRST:*
  enumerate the device's verb surfaces (widget focus / world-space press / hold-E / overlap) and grep the
  claim writer for the edge each raises. `memory/lesson_claim_gated_intent_lane_must_cover_every_entry_surface.md`
- **A mirrored float feeding a native `>= X` latch needs EXACT-SNAP, not an asymptote.** v111 BUG-4:
  SimInterp's window reopens on every 10 Hz packet -> never snaps to exactly 1.0 -> sub-ulp freeze just
  under the detector latch -> the client's unsuppressed native block re-crosses the threshold every frame
  -> stuck beep. Check (a) the interp actually emits exactly X under packet cadence, (b) the local
  crossing side-effect is suppressed/idempotent. **v112 corollary: the exact-snap must be PER-CHANNEL**
  (a whole-vector skip never fires while any channel moves — decoded accrues every packet), and a
  DISCRETE channel (0/1 flag) never rides the ease at all — snap on arrival. **v115b BOUNDARY:
  exact-snap does NOT extend to EVENT-FIRING machines — the ping FSM's stage transitions are
  `==1.0` checks whose consequences are events/spawns/append-text; snapping values onto any
  un-parked machine fires them locally = double events. Such machines: single-author only.**

  from GROUND TRUTH** (v115b audit CRIT-1: a SOLO host's ping edge was absorbed by the unwired
  baseline → a mid-ping joiner got no FSM-hold; desk_input gates its BOOKKEEPING on connected()
  while device_occupancy gates only the SEND — two adjacent lanes, opposite gating, one silent
  hole). Seed in ConnectReplayForSlot by reading the ENGINE state, never the baseline; never

  (v115b root-3: the catch replay's ResetDownloadMachine made the dish mesh transiently invalid
  ~24 s → the ARM/DISARM edge poll broadcast a false DISARM that stomped the fresh catch. A
  one-shot flag loses the legit ARM on fast respawns; a timer is a guess. The predicate: mesh

- **Presser-authored STATE broadcasts, never intent lanes, for EX-invisible verbs.** The verb has
  ALREADY run locally (incl. RNG rolls + id mints) before any seam can see it — "intent -> host
  executes" cannot exist; detect the local change (PE seam > raw-field poll > VM-bracket dirty-mark),
  broadcast field-granular deltas, receivers apply+prime in the same GT task, host relays EXCLUDING
  the originator (an echo reverts a newer local value = the eaten-scroll race). *Look FIRST:* the

  consolidation, verified at `event_feed.cpp:499-517` — each `Handle*Event` returns true iff the kind is
  in its family, so the FAMILY switch is the single membership declaration). **Do not touch
  `event_feed.cpp` for a new kind.** Current: `protocol.h` (enum+payload+static_assert+version bump) →

- **Host TRACKING/enroll gates on HOSTING, never `connected()`.** `memory/lesson_tracking_gates_on_hosting_not_connected.md`
- **EVERY session-end path runs the FULL teardown fanout** — AND session-scoped UI (chat feed/input/
  bubbles/nameplate/voice_panel) dies at the FLEE funnel (`FleeToMainMenu`), NOT `DisconnectAll` (which
  also runs on the HOST keeping its world, so it must not clear on-screen UI). **A RESET alone is not
  enough if a per-tick EDGE DETECTOR re-fires AFTER it:** `session.Stop()` flips slots -> the next
  `event_feed::Update` re-Pushes "Host left the game" into the just-cleared feed (client self-quit,
  `e02343c4`) -> also disarm the producer (`SuppressPeerLeaveEdges`). *Look FIRST:* net_pump.cpp:184

- **A host-auth FROZEN mirror displaying slightly stale = a TRANSPORT+CADENCE bug, NOT authority.** Fix
  the refresh (periodic UNRELIABLE absolute snapshot at display cadence, pose-stream pattern); do NOT hand
  the client simulation + clamp it back (lateral/regression + a per-broadcast site-list). Clock design F
  (v110, `2dde3e16`): client stays frozen mirror, clock streams `ClockPose=37`. *Look FIRST:* smooth-sun
  needs advancing `totalTime` through `ReceiveTick` which fires every `newMinute`/`newHour` -> that path
  is gated on enumerating those consumers. `memory/lesson_frozen_mirror_desync_is_transport_not_authority.md`
- **`subsystems::Install` is called EVERY net_pump tick (idempotent contract)** — net_pump.cpp:766, "one-
  shot install ... idempotent"; each sub-Install MUST latch its noisy/expensive work or it re-runs per
  frame (desk_diag ENABLED banner ~37k/session, `2de202ed`). *Look FIRST:* add a `static bool` latch to
  any new Install that logs/allocates/hooks/resolves. `memory/lesson_subsystems_install_runs_every_tick_must_latch.md` (SHARPENED v120: a success-only latch whose FAILED retry re-runs FindClass = a 60 Hz pre-world array-walk bomb — put every resolve retry behind a throttled gate or a cached resolver).
  **THIRD INSTANCE 2026-08-29, and it arrived in an ADOPTED COMMIT:** `ko_respawn::Install` (cherry-picked
  from a contributor the night before) logged unconditionally — ~30 identical lines per second, measured
  in the smoke's log diff — and, worse, **cleared its own `g_interceptorInstalled` latch every tick**, so
  the lazy `RegisterInterceptor` re-entered forever instead of latching once. A contributor cannot know a
  rule that lives in our memory; **the ADOPTER owes the check.** *Look FIRST:* when cherry-picking a
  module that defines `Install(Session*)`, diff its first lines against a sibling's before merging —
  refresh the session pointer, then `if (g_installed) return;`.
- **One bool latch fusing DISTINCT terminal states (success vs DISABLED) makes some consumer's gate
  wrong for one of them** — pre-s27 kerfur_convert `g_installed=true` meant BOTH "ready" and "module
  disabled", so the request gate PASSED requests in the disabled state (the exact zeroed-frame
  over-read the disable existed to prevent; latent, found by the s27 split's per-state gate
  re-derivation). Enumerate (terminal state × consumer gate) before touching any init latch; one
  latch = one meaning. *Look FIRST:* kerfur_convert_host.h (the documented fail-closed deviation).

- **Every client-side SUPPRESSION is a LOAN, not a purchase (N=3: weather 06-11, serverbox 07-09,
  garbage_sync 07-10).** Persistent-state neutralizations (tick-disable, field-zero, TimeScale=0,
  suppress flags) need an EXPLICIT OnDisconnect restore; fn-body PRE-cancels SELF-restore ONLY when
  gated on `s->running()`/`connected()` — a bare `role()==Client` gate keeps suppressing in SOLO play
  forever (Stop never resets cfg_.role). ADDED 2026-07-16: the restore must RE-LOOKUP a live
  instance (never PE-dispatch on the cached parked ptr = UAF; caught twice — serverbox 07-10,
  dish tickers 07-16 audit F1). *Look FIRST:* name the restore mechanism in the SAME commit;
  census: grep bare role-gates without running(). `memory/lesson_suppression_needs_paired_restore_or_running_gate.md`
- **Killing a BP latent frame-loop by clearing its gate flag exits at the loop HEAD — the whole
  arrival/END chain is skipped and stale** (dish: looping motor cues stay Active forever;
  `activeDishes[i]` stuck true → the OnKeyDown ping gate blocks that peer permanently); and
  CO-WRITING a live loop's component never oscillates — it STARVES the loop's arrival check
  indefinitely (it re-reads fresh, steps toward its LOCAL target, checks its own post-write value).
  Park = kill + explicit end-chain cleanup; mirror only onto a DEAD loop. COROLLARY 07-16: a
  one-shot sweep can't outrun a PENDING latent (movePow re-arms audio at the delayed resume,

  SPAWNS a fresh one (class from the signal DT row)** — back-to-back formDownload CONVERGES (safe

  The L4 draft shipped 312/388 B structs before reading the caps; the shipped pattern = u16
  centidegrees (`QuantDeg`, 0.01 deg vs the 1.0-deg native tolerance) + u16/65535 scalars →
  full-24-dish packets fit (168/196/100 B). Oversize-by-design = the chunking precedents, not a

- **A CLIENT-born Aprop_C crosses at the SPAWN seam, never "at place"** — client spawns don't
  broadcast (local ghost) and a plain drop/throw fires NO FinishSpawn (only pocket→place does);
  the reusable seam = the F2 client FinishSpawn drain (Init already minted the NewGuid key) →
  class-gated intent → `HostSpawnPlacedProp` born-ASLEEP → the held-prop stream drives it →
  adopt-by-key. First instance: ReelEjectIntent=104 (L7 v114 `ba8ce297`). *Look FIRST:*

- **A save-scalar birth channel must be filled at EVERY birth/author path** (live express + join
  snapshot + container extract + BOTH client intent kinds) via ONE shared per-class reader —
  missing one path = a CDO-default mirror re-broadcast as truth (the L7 correctness CRITICAL:
  pocket→place respawned a blank tape). **R14-16 `/qf` CONVERGED 2026-07-21 → DESIGN `d14b6644`
  (NOT built):** generalize the birth carrier from a `savedScalar` FLOAT to a per-class CONTENT trailer
  (reel→Progress; drive→`DC::ReadDriveRow`+`signal_wire`), inline, RETIRING savedScalar; a client drop
  is a genuine inventory→world birth (`PropDropIntent` carried only the float). **Birth-state ≠
  steady-state** — KEEP `drive_sync`'s `DrivePayload` (a disc mutating in a rack is not a birth). *Look
  FIRST:* prop.h savedScalar block; grep `ReadSavedScalarForClass`;
  `votv-drive-disc-content-birth-DESIGN-2026-07-21.md`. **EMISSION SITS ABOVE CONTENT (measured
  2026-07-22):** `prop_drop_intent.cpp` is ONE funnel — `:279` `if (!parked && !freshBirth) continue;`
  decides WHO is announced, `:293` decides WHAT the survivor carries (this lesson's axis), `:307` is
  gated by the same whitelist. `freshBirth` is a CLASS whitelist (reel v114 → module v118 → drive
  v119), so `d14b6644` works for drives but any non-whitelisted class (an ordinary item a client
  extracts from a container) is discarded at `:279` and the content channel is never called. **One
  design, two axes, not a stack.** Widening `:279` is not a one-liner: `freshBirth` also sets
  `pf::kSleep`. *Look FIRST:* check `:279` before designing what a client birth carries — if the class
  cannot pass the gate, the payload question is moot.

- **A held/collected keyed prop is PER-PLAYER INVENTORY data, not a world actor** — a `SaveRecord` in
  `saveSlot.hold[]`/`inventory[]`, streamed+persisted per-GUID by `player_inventory_sync` SEPARATELY
  from the world save. So a client pickup CORRECTLY destroys the world actor (it went into inventory);
  a host-side world custody-actor for it DOUBLE-WRITES → two props on reload. Before designing any
  "keep the prop alive / custody across a client pickup," check `mainPlayer.hpp playerTryToCollect` —
  if collectible, custody IS the inventory blob; a pickup is an inventory↔world BIRTH to sync, not an
  actor to keep. *Look FIRST:* `player_inventory_sync.cpp`; `inventory.h SaveRecord`.

  direction. `memory/lesson_email_sync_peer_symmetric_client_false_notice_pollutes_shared.md`
- **`server` naming/placement:** a signal-SERVER sync goes with its signal siblings in
  `coop/interactables/` (signal_sync/console_state_sync), named after the engine class (`serverBox_C` →

  byte-by-byte (desk `DL_downloading @66736`: `RandomFloatInRange` needle + `RandomFloat` noise sit IN the

  output-mirror. **COROLLARY (v111 AS-BUILT):** measure SEEDED-vs-unseeded + STORED-vs-transient first —
  the desk `noise` is unseeded AND transient (never stored; 0 RandomStream) → seed-sync structurally
  impossible → host-auth FORCED; and if the client sim writes only display-local, you OVERWRITE the

- **Peer-keyed mirror lanes have 3 measured traps** (owner_entity_sync audit): a CLIENT has no transport
  edge for another client's slot → leaver teardown must be HOST-FANNED; your own mirror spawn re-enters

  the hand-item swing rendered at "1 fps" under a 0.5 s drift-gated reliable resend; split identity
  (reliable announce) from motion (MsgType::HandPose=35, RagdollPose plumbing end-to-end). AND the
  mirror interp must DEDUPE identical-target packets + ADAPT its window to the position-CHANGE cadence

  the write, GT run-to-completion makes a single-GT-task clear+repopulate atomic w.r.t. them (the only
  tear is splitting it across frames). No build-then-swap, no generation counter — just overwrite in one

  `ConnState::Handshaking(1)`, holds a conn handle (IsSlotConnected TRUE) but never latches lanes, so a
  connected-edge detector fires a FALSE "Remote player left the game" (default nick, Join never processed)

  meadow idiom)** — per-slot multiset capture at save_transfer's OnRequest, both-signs seedDelta at
  ConnectReplayForSlot; drill-proven RED (loss reproduced under the capture-disabled mutate) →

  lane" reduced to one lid bool, and the TRACKER's "own floppyTypes/floppyData" premise was a

  async-load / GC churn. Reconcile by an INTRINSIC key (save Key / save position), never by the bound
  eid. Born from the 2026-06-29 hands-on regression: a kerfur off->active retire-by-eid destroyed the

- **Classify engine READS into four kinds before pricing an extraction.** "This module reads the
  engine" hides four unrelated things: *intent production* (read the local player — STAYS forever),
  *handle validation* (is this pointer live — DISAPPEARS, the extracted side holds ids not pointers),
  *outcome capture* (what did the engine machine decide — STAYS, you record it), and *canon derivation*
  (read the engine to BUILD the authoritative state — the ONLY work, invert to write-only). Measured
  2026-07-20: `device_occupancy` 9/9 intent, `drive_sync` ~12/15 handle-validation, `signal_catch_sync`
  5/6 outcome-capture — so the heaviest-reading lane was the cheapest to move and read COUNT is
  uncorrelated with migration cost. Canon derivation totalled **32 sites in 9 lanes** (a name-shape
  grep = order of magnitude, NOT a verified list — keep that caveat beside the table).
  LOOK FIRST: `docs/COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md` §6-§7.

- **Anchor an accumulator; never stream it.** A value that is a function of elapsed time
  (`dryTimer += DeltaSeconds`) should not get a sync channel — store ONE start stamp and let each peer
  compute it. Buys, for free: no stream, impossible divergence, **late join solved** (the joiner gets a
  stamp and is instantly correct — no snapshot cadence, no mid-activity window), and an empty server
  can FREEZE. Precedent measured: MTA's `CClock.cpp` is 58 LOC of pure formula with **no tick**. Valid
  ONLY if the RATE is constant — so measure the input set of the RATE, not the value; a rain/indoor/
  temperature gate sends the element back to a syncer. Park the brain regardless, or the local
  accumulator fights the computed value. LOOK FIRST: `docs/COOP_WORLD_PROP_DIVERGENCE.md` (2026-07-20

- **Storing state you cannot parse: the DONOR owns everything your canon doesn't cover.** An
  engine-free arbiter holds the world save opaquely (bytes + hash; GVAS is never deserialised outside
  the engine). Two consequences the storage decision itself never mentions: (1) whoever DONATES the
  blob silently authors the entire unsynced remainder — so donation must be host/admin-only, recorded
  as `docs/security/TRACKER.md` **F1** before any donation path exists; (2) **the blob's re-donation
  cadence is the INVERSE of canon coverage** — which converts "the server's authority grows with every
  sync lane" from a slogan into an observable metric, and its complement is the trust exposure. The
  trap: blob-then-overlay already exists in the tree (joiner loads the host save, `prop_snapshot`
  reconciles by key), and that familiarity hides the new authority question. LOOK FIRST:

- **2026-08-23 — a documented invalidation can have ZERO callers; grep the call sites, and know the
  absorb hides failure from the caller.** `Registry::InvalidateLocal()` is promised by
  `input_owner.cpp:116` ("cleared on a level change") and has NO call site at `50b78d47` — so after a
  SOLO quit-to-menu the warm cache (slot+serial `Alive()`, no world identity) served the dead world's
  pawn for 44+ s, `GetController(dead pawn)` returned the dead PC, and input_owner's 1 Hz sweep fed it
  into `HasUserFocusedDescendants` on ~2,508 widgets/sweep → ~2,508 absorbed AVs/s for 44 s (78% of a
  12.35 MB field log). Four stacked traps: comment-as-wiring; liveness≠world-validity; the absorb
  lands BELOW `R::CallFunction` so the sweep sees a clean `false` and cannot latch; and the trigger
  flow (solo → quit → join) is ordinary for players yet exercised by NO autonomous smoke (0 instances
  in all 4 local logs). ~~Fix shape: wire the invalidation from the ONE world-change authority~~ —
  **CORRECTED 2026-08-23 eve: wiring it was IMPOSSIBLE; `InvalidateLocal()` was DELETED instead

- **2026-08-23 — invalidating a cache whose REFILL is equally blind is a no-op that looks like a fix.**
  The prescribed cure for the row above was "wire the missing `InvalidateLocal()` edge". Reading the
  refill path killed it: `RescanLocal`'s filter is `IsLive` + non-null `Controller`, and the dead pawn
  passes BOTH — so an immediate re-walk re-caches the identical bug and buys one full GUObjectArray
  walk. What shipped is the missing term at **both** points (a world stamp compared at `Alive()`, a
  world filter in the rescan loop) and `InvalidateLocal()` **deleted**, because once the predicate is
  complete the cache self-heals and a second mechanism for one invariant is RULE-2 baggage. *Look
  FIRST:* before wiring ANY invalidation, open the refill path and ask "would a fresh read return the
  same wrong thing?" `memory/lesson_invalidating_a_cache_whose_refill_is_equally_blind.md`
- **2026-08-23 — a crutch usually NAMES ITSELF in its own justifying comment.** The destroy seam's
  world-load gate was scoped `!keyless`, excused as *"piles are already fixed and the host DEFERS them
  anyway"* — a confession that the traffic was known garbage, tolerated because the RECEIVER swallowed
  it. Cost, reproduced locally 1:1 with the field: **871** spurious `PropDestroy`s per client join
  (field 940), each carrying a client-band eid the host has never seen, all **871** parked and expired
  (field 1,618) — landing in the same minute as **485** sends refused for a full buffer. Deleting two
  words gave 871 → 0 (`65fccd70`). Second confession, same day and same area: `UnmarkAndDestroy`'s
  "drop the eid first so the seam stays silent" was false by construction — `UnmarkKnownKeyedProp`
  DEFERS the Element destruction, so the actor→eid reverse is still live when the seam runs
  synchronously inside the next line's `DestroyActor`. *Look FIRST:* grep for "handles it anyway" /
  "already fixed" / "the receiver dedupes", and price each under a join flood, not steady state.

- **2026-08-23 — a predicate added to a SHARED cache type lands inside every full-array walk.** Adding
  a world term to `CachedObjRef::Alive()` (~67 uses) reads as O(1) per probe; the post-ship audit
  measured it reached **per object inside six 237k-object GUObjectArray walks**, three levels below the
  loop (`prop::IsClassDescendantOfProp` → `PropBaseClass()` → `g_propBaseCls.Alive()`), the heaviest at
  5 Hz **during a join** — projected +200–300 ms/s on the reporting machine. Cure: guard the expensive
  accessor behind the cheap local field (`if (world_)`), zeroing it for exactly the class/CDO holders
  those loops use. Then the guard **thinned a drive nobody had documented** — `Alive()` was the
  de-facto refresh heartbeat — and the measured travel edge regressed 1 s → 5 s until an explicit
  driver was added. *Look FIRST:* before adding any term to a shared primitive, follow the per-object
  predicates of every `for (i < NumObjects())` loop down to it.

- **2026-08-23 — a drill that kills boot is worse than no drill; it falsifies what it was built to
  prove.** The rate-latch drill killed the game twice: `nullptr` as the UFunction (`LogObserverAv`
  derefs it via `NameOf`), then running from the top of `Install()` — 123 reflection lookups on the
  loader thread before our own dispatcher existed. Env-gating contains the behaviour, not the
  CONCLUSION: the next reader arms it, sees a dead process, and decides the detector is broken. The
  discriminator that separates "my instrument" from "my change" is one command — a run with the drill
  disabled. *Look FIRST:* place one-shot drills AFTER the subsystem they measure is live, and feed them
  real objects. `memory/lesson_a_drill_that_kills_boot_is_worse_than_no_drill.md`
- **2026-08-24 — an entity-death discriminator must be fail-CLOSED, and the census that settles it is
  the census of DEATHS, not of reads.** A design was going to read "this mirror coin died locally and it
  was not our wire destroy" as "the player collected it", made sound by draining the registry row before
  every one of OUR teardowns kills an actor. That ordering discipline is correct and still insufficient:
  of the eight ways a mirror can die, **four — killZ, level unload, GC purge (which never calls
  `K2_DestroyActor` at all), and another actor destroying it — can never be made to announce themselves
  first.** The design's own earlier finding described a coin drifting away and dying unattended, so the
  discriminator would have read "it fell into the void" as "someone collected it" and the host would have
  **minted real currency**. A false negative costs a missed pickup; a false positive creates money, so
  the argument must come from the expensive side. *Look FIRST:* when inferring an event from a
  destruction, enumerate every killer including the engine's; name the noun your census actually covered
  (reads ≠ deaths); and act on POSITIVE evidence that you are inside the verb, never on the absence of
  the causes you happen to own. `memory/lesson_an_entity_death_discriminator_must_be_fail_closed.md`

- **A CORRECTOR OWES A CONVERGENCE CHECK — a nudge cannot move a body at rest.** 2026-08-29, ATV arc 1.
  Correcting a simulating mirror by biasing its VELOCITY is right for a moving body and achieves exactly
  zero against a resting one: a 20 cm/s corrective velocity is erased by gravity in 20 ms, and the error
  stood unchanged for a whole 150 s run while the correction was applied every packet. Two sizing facts
  from the same pass: a FIXED correction window oscillates at the wrong cadence (`e' = e*(1 - dt/T)`, so
  `T = 0.10 s` converges at `dt = 50 ms`, gives **zero decay** at 200 ms and GROWS beyond it — one
  constant cannot serve two cadences), and the fix that closed it is a **stall detector** counting
  PACKETS in which the error refused to shrink, escalating to a cut. It needs no velocity threshold,
  because velocity is the quantity lying about whether convergence is possible. *Look FIRST:* every
  error-closing loop owes a cheap "packets where the error did not shrink" counter and an escalation —
  without one, "I applied a correction" and "the correction worked" are indistinguishable from inside
  the code. `memory/lesson_a_corrector_owes_a_convergence_check.md`

## 4. Dispatch, hooks & input seams

- **OBSERVE/CANCEL A SCRIPT UFUNCTION ON EVERY DISPATCH ROUTE: don't nativize the target (Option E's dead end) — inject a prologue that CALLS your own nativized ZERO-PARAM bool marker.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, decompiled from Relay's shipped binary (field-proven in production): prologue = `EX_JumpIfNot <skip-to-relocated-body> [EX_FinalFunction <your marker> <ctx> EX_EndFunctionParms] <return path>`, body shifted, the five absolute-jump opcodes' u32 operands relocated by +prologueSize, originals recorded + restored on map load. Zero params = nothing for the native thunk to marshal (the exact blocker that killed our Option E), and `EX_FinalFunction` hands the native the CALLER's frame — so the handler reads/writes the gated function's own params and returns the cancel verdict. Hard limits: **ubergraph bodies are unpatchable** (event stubs in OTHER functions embed the uber entry offset as constants), natives have no Script, a foreign mod's prologue must be REFUSED not overwritten. Closes `COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md`'s "only remaining invisible class" WITH args+cancel; principle-1-legal (runtime memory patch). **Look here FIRST:** the VISIBILITY row-103 addendum + `COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` §6 addendum + the study §5. Status: CANDIDATE tier, NOT built, /qf owed. [[lesson-cancel-a-script-function-by-calling-your-own-zero-param-native]]

- **A GUARD CAN BE UNSATISFIABLE WITH ITS OWN CALLER -- the code is then unreachable, not merely hard to reach.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: I gave a world-mutating dev probe the guard `if (running() || connected()) return;`. The only path to that function is `net_pump::Tick` -> `subsystems::TickGameplay` (`subsystems.cpp:624`), and `session_runtime.cpp` calls `net_pump::Tick` at `:298`/`:336` inside loops that break on `!running()` and at `:696` under `if (running)` -- so `running()` is a PRECONDITION of arriving at the guard. Guard and caller were mutually exclusive; the probe could never fire again in any configuration. It read as correct because it IS correct in isolation -- the defect exists only in the composition, which is exactly what a diff does not show. It also produced a plausible wrong symptom: I reported "unverified because `mp.py` has no session-less launch", which is true, adjacent, and not the reason (a session-less launch takes the branch that calls `subsystems::Install` and nothing else). **Look here FIRST:** when you add an early-return guard, open the caller and read its gate in the same sitting and ask *can both be true at once*; census the call sites rather than naming them (my fixed comment first claimed one call site; there are three); and prove a guarded path still runs by RUNNING it and reading its line, because the symptom of an unsatisfiable guard is silence, which is also the symptom of nothing to report. [[lesson-a-guard-can-be-unsatisfiable-with-its-own-caller]]

- **A detour declares the CALLEE's arity, not the arity of the function whose NAME you gave it.**
  `[V]` 2026-08-30, disassembled from the shipping PE: the overlay's DX12 resize seam at
  `image+0x177E8B0` was recorded as "FD3D12Viewport::Resize" and hooked with a five-argument
  detour. It is `FD3D12Viewport::ResizeInternal()` and takes **only `this`** -- its seventh
  instruction is `mov edx,3`, which DESTROYS the register a second argument would arrive in, and
  it reads the extent from a member (`mov edx,[rbx+0x90]`). Its single caller at
  `image+0x1777110` is the real four-argument `Resize`, which stores them to members and calls
  the seam with `mov rcx,rbp` and nothing else. **It did not crash**, which is why it survived:
  the surplus arguments were never read. What broke was the INSTRUMENT -- the bracket's log line
  printed the four values from caller register residue, and the design calls that line the one
  thing proving the bracket survived RTSS. *Look FIRST:* read the prologue for which of
  RCX/RDX/R8/R9 is consumed before it is clobbered, and open ONE call site -- `mov rcx,<this>`
  and nothing else settles arity in seconds and also tells you whether you hooked the wrapper or
  the worker. Hooking the right function and knowing its contract are different claims. Return
  types deserve the same suspicion: the DX12 present seam is `bool` in UE but TAIL-JUMPS to an
  HRESULT, so it is forwarded as an opaque register-width integer.

  UNDO a completed `Shutdown`.** 2026-08-26, found by the post-ship audit *of the teardown fix
  itself*. `[V]` `hook::Install` guarded entry with `if (!g_live && !Init())`; `[V]` `Init()` treats
  `MH_ERROR_ALREADY_INITIALIZED` as success and sets `g_live = true`; `[V]` `Shutdown()` deliberately
  never uninitializes MinHook (freeing a trampoline corrupts it in place). Compose those and the guard
  is a **resurrection** -- after a completed teardown it revives the facade and arms a patch nothing
  will ever lift, since `DoShutdown`'s latch means `hook::Shutdown` never runs twice. `[V]` The live
  path is `overlay_backend_dx12_capture`'s `EclHookThread`, an un-joined `::CreateThread` that
  `DoShutdown` does not wait for. It survived the commit that was ABOUT this: that commit gave
  `Enable()` a compare-after-act and wrote *"Both orders end disabled"* -- true of `Enable`, false of
  `Install`, one function away. `g_live` was answering "has init succeeded" (yes, after teardown) and
  "may a patch arm" (no) at once, and they diverge in exactly the state teardown creates. Fixed with a
  one-way **retirement latch**. *Look FIRST:* say in one sentence what your flag answers -- if it needs
  an "and", it is two flags; ask specifically what `Init()` does AFTER `Shutdown()`; and note a
  monotonic LATCH is not a mutable mirror, so the standing objection that "two flags that can disagree
  leave neither as authority" does not transfer to it.

- **Synthesized input goes to the FOREGROUND window, not to yours — and `GetActiveWindow()` does not
  ask that question.** 2026-08-26: the browser selftest gated `keybd_event`/`mouse_event` on
  `::GetActiveWindow()` being non-null, treating it as "the game is there". That call reports the
  active window OF THE CALLING THREAD and says nothing about who receives injected input, which the
  OS routes to whatever holds the foreground. `[V]` The result was a set of pairs no code difference
  explains: ESC closing the screen failed 13:24 / passed 13:32, the X click failed 13:47 / passed
  13:32 and 13:55, the wheel failed 13:47 / passed 13:44, 13:51, 13:55 — every one of them blaming
  the feature for the harness's fault. Fix: `::GetForegroundWindow()` **plus**
  `ui::input_focus::IsOurWindowForeground()` (which already existed for this exact class of
  question), with "not ours" a bounded WAIT. **The general shape is the lesson**: an instrument that
  answers a NARROWER question than the one you asked returns a *plausible* answer, so it reads as a
  real finding rather than as a broken measurement. Two more the same day — the same null check
  disarmed the probe SILENTLY, so a focus-less run logged not one phase and reported every verdict as
  "never ran" (indistinguishable from a missing feature), and a log line emitted under `< 8 || % 200`
  was counted as 12 events when its own counter showed ~801 fired. *Look FIRST:* if an input-driving
  test is flaky, suspect focus before the feature; write down the question you are asking and the
  question the API answers and check they are the same sentence; make "the probe stood down" a
  different string from "the verdict is absent".
  **(2026-08-29 instance, the red-mist root: a selftest whose STIMULUS enters through the fix's own
  seam certifies the seam, not the feature.** The redsky selftest drove `DebugForce` — a reflected
  Call = ProcessEvent — while the lane's detectors were PE POST observers; the GAME's own trigger is
  `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`, PE-invisible, so the observers never fired for one organic red sky in
  the lane's life while the selftest kept passing. The stimulus must enter the way the game enters,
  or the test must say it tests the reflected path only.)

- **A MODULE HEADER IS NOT THE CAPABILITY MAP — a whole design cascade was built on one sentence in
  `ufunction_hook.h` while `COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md:88` stated the opposite IN BOLD.** 2026-08-24,
  `/qf` rounds 34-35. `[SRC]` `ue_wrap/core/ufunction_hook.h` says a BP-internal call — listing
  `EX_CallMath / EX_FinalFunction / EX_VirtualFunction / EX_Local*Function` — routes through
  `UFunction::Func`, and that *"EVERY dispatch path funnels through Func, so the hook fires regardless
  of the caller's opcode."* That is true **only for a NATIVE callee**. `[MEASURED]`
  `docs/COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md:88`: a SCRIPT UFunction called via `EX_Local*Function` is
  *"INVISIBLE to BOTH ProcessEvent AND a Func patch (EX_Local\* never goes through `UFunction::Func`)"*
  and is *"THE ONLY REMAINING INVISIBLE CLASS"*; `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md:300-304` pins it in IDA
  (both handlers branch on `FunctionFlags & 0x400` @`UFunction+0xB0` → `Invoke`/Func@`+0xD8` for native
  vs `ProcessScriptFunction` → `ProcessInternal` for script, which never reads `Func`) and records
  **"Option E ELIMINATED BY MEASUREMENT"** on 2026-07-13. Every Func patch the project ships
  (`BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`, `K2_DestroyActor`, `AudioComponent::Play`) is native — which is
  precisely why the header reads as it does: an accurate description of ITS OWN consumers, and a false
  generalisation about the engine. The cascade it produced ("we can cancel a BP verb, so the
  act-as-host lane simplifies, so F0b's suppression dissolves, so the `0x45` registration and F6
  dissolve with it") was entirely wrong, and the patch would have **installed successfully** (`Func` =
  `ProcessInternal`, non-null, passes the null guard), logged `"patched ufn=… slot N"`, and never
  fired — the same silent-no-op defect class the lane was being fixed for.
  **LOOK HERE FIRST:** before claiming ANY seam can observe, drive, or CANCEL something, open
  `docs/COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md` — `CLAUDE.md`'s reading order already mandates it at step 4. A
  module header answers *"how do I use this facility"*; the map answers *"is this possible at all"*,
  and a design rests on the second. When they disagree, **the map wins and the header is a doc
  defect**. **SECOND SHAPE 2026-08-25 — with no map to consult, the NEIGHBOUR became the spec.**
  Answering "should the main-menu buttons move to a pak?", a build plan asserted the MULTIPLAYER
  button is *"a real `UButton` whose `FButtonStyle` is cloned from the live `button_start`"* and
  argued from it that *a clone tracks the game while an authored asset freezes it*.
  `engine_widget.cpp:373-500` says otherwise: it walks `refButton`'s slot to its parent `UVerticalBox`
  and adds ours as a **sibling** (slot/layout parity is structural — that part is real), but the
  label's style is **hardcoded constants measured once** from `bp_reflection/ui_menu.json` (`font_ui`,
  size 16, shadow (2,2), black), the label is **deliberately tinted cyan**, and the comment ends
  **"(Font parity is deferred.)"**. So the argument was backwards — our values freeze exactly like a
  pak's — and a third of the case was retracted inside the hour, in a doc another session had been
  told to build from. The wrong inference came from `InjectTextRowAbove` twenty lines below: same
  argument shape, and its comment **explicitly says it clones**. *Look FIRST:* **a neighbour is not a
  specification** — a shared naming pattern is a reason to read BOTH bodies; **treat a MISSING claim
  as a claim** (if the sibling's header states a behaviour and this one's does not, the default is
  that it does not do it); and **before a mechanism claim becomes an ARGUMENT, open the body** — a
  header is enough to *use* a function, not to reason about what it guarantees. Cheap tell here:
  parity written as hardcoded constants with a `bp_reflection/...` citation is measured-once, not
  tracking; grep the body for any read of the reference object, and if the only reads are offsets
  into our own new widget, nothing is being cloned.
  Full: `memory/lesson_a_module_header_is_not_the_capability_map.md`.
  **SAME FAILURE, TWICE IN ONE SESSION — the general form is CONFIRMATION-STOPPING.** `/qf` round 39,
  minutes later: asked whether MTA heartbeats its entity streams, I read
  `CUnoccupiedVehicleSync.cpp:64` (`ulCurrentTime >= m_ulLastSyncTime + UNOCCUPIED_VEHICLE_SYNC_RATE`)
  and reported "MTA is rate-driven". That is a RATE LIMITER; the actual send site 300 lines later is
  change-gated (`:387-389`, *"If nothing has changed we dont sync the vehicle"*), as are
  `CPedSync.cpp:314-316` and `CObjectSync.cpp:227-229`. The false citation reversed the design's
  direction for a full round. **A gate is not a send; a header is not a map; an entry point is not a
  mechanism — read to the site where the thing you are claiming actually HAPPENS, and cite THAT line.**

- **An overlay that inline-hooks `IDXGISwapChain::Present` LOSES to RivaTuner and is INVISIBLE to OBS
  game-capture — two user-reported defects, one root: we sit too far down the Present chain.**
  2026-08-22. `[AUTH]` RTSS does not overwrite prologues like MinHook/Detours — it unwinds the jmp
  chain, injects after the LAST jump (deliberately last), and runs **hook-integrity control that
  restores its own bytes**, kicking a later inline hooker out of the chain; `[MEASURED]` on this box
  RTSS resolves `Present`/`Present1`/`ResizeBuffers`/`ExecuteCommandLists` by DLL-relative offset —
  exactly our functions. `[SRC]` obs-studio `dxgi-capture.cpp`: with `capture_overlay` FALSE (the
  DEFAULT) OBS copies the backbuffer at the TOP of its own `hook_present`, i.e. BEFORE calling the
  real Present — so a hook installed after OBS's (ours; OBS injects at capture start) draws too late
  to be captured. The working precedents all draw UPSTREAM of the inline chain: MTA via a COM PROXY
  device (`CProxyDirect3DDevice9::Present` -> GUI -> real Present, plus explicit RTSS-coexistence in
  `CreateDeviceSecondCallCheck`), ReShade via a creation-time swapchain WRAPPER. A ReShade-style
  wrapper is unavailable to us (measured 2026-07-26: our boot does NOT precede swapchain creation),
  so the seam is caller-side: `FD3D11Viewport::PresentChecked`. **Look FIRST:
  `docs/OVERLAY_CAPTURE_COEXIST.md` (sole live-tracked doc) before touching the overlay's present
  hook, the DXGI hooks, or the present signatures. And treat "who ELSE patches this function?" as a
  standing question for every inline hook — this is the SECOND instance of the class after the UE4SS
  PolyHook/ProcessEvent collision.**
  **2026-08-23 — that standing question is now CHEAP to answer, and the answer was bigger than assumed:**
  `tools/debug/present_hook_census.py` reads each present-chain prologue on a LIVE process and follows
  the jmp chain to the owning module. Result: `Present` + `ResizeBuffers` are ours, and
  **`IDXGISwapChain1::Present1` is hooked by `NahimicOSD.dll`** — an A-Volute audio-driver overlay
  nobody knew was in the process (so the chain holds us + RTSS-when-armed + OBS-when-capturing +
  Nahimic). Two corollaries worth carrying: **a tool being LOADED is not a tool being ARMED** —
  `RTSSHooks64.dll` is present even at detection level None, and neither the process list nor RTSS's
  ini settles it, only the target's bytes; and **"this box reproduces the bug" is itself a claim that
  needs measuring** — an earlier revision of the coexistence doc asserted it while the user had RTSS
  detection globally off, so the box reproduced NEITHER symptom.
  **2026-08-23 evening — S1's MECHANISM MEASURED, and the "we lost the install race" model is WRONG.**
  With RTSS armed: `imgui_overlay: DX11 bring-up OK` DOES appear, so our detour fires, ImGui comes up,
  the WndProc detour installs and **an RTV is created** — and only THEN does `frames=0/s` set in
  (sustained 8+ s at `PE=243537/s`, against a `frames=120/s` control at the same PE rate 20 min
  earlier with RTSS off). **RTSS lets you install and reclaims the function AFTERWARDS, per-function
  and STAGGERED** — with `Present` already dead our `ResizeBuffers` bracket still ran once and was
  gone ~90 s later. Consequence: being on ANY DXGI vtable function is a losing POSITION, not a race
  lost at install time, so "hook earlier" is not a fix. Diagnostic that settles it in one read:
  `frames=N/s` (the `perf_probe::NoteFrame()` counter, driven from `PresentDetour`) against a
  same-build control — a live per-frame counter distinguishes "unlinked" from "drawing but invisible"
  where a screenshot cannot.

- **A hooked RESIZE bracket is load-bearing: drop it and `ResizeBuffers` FAILS the engine into a
  FATAL.** 2026-08-23, measured with a real crash dialog. `[SRC MSDN]` `IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers`
  returns `DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL` unless every direct AND indirect reference to the back buffers is
  released first — an `ID3D11RenderTargetView` created on the backbuffer is exactly such a reference
  (`overlay_backend_dx11.cpp:34-48`), and `[MEASURED]` UE turns the failure into
  `VERIFYD3D11RESULT_EX` → **`Fatal`**: `LowLevelFatalError ... D3D11Viewport.cpp:298 ...
  DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL`. The trap that makes this expensive: **a post-hoc "detect the backbuffer
  changed" check at the DRAW seam cannot substitute for a release BEFORE the resize** — an overlay
  redesign had exactly that substitution in it, `/qf`-converged over 7 rounds, and it would have
  turned an RTSS-only crash into a crash for every user on every resize. Two more carryables: the
  crash text named the **same function and line** (`D3D11Viewport.cpp:298`) that IDA had identified
  hours earlier from UE's own `VERIFYD3D11RESULT_EX` argument string, so **UE ships its verify
  expressions AND line numbers into the shipping exe and a crash dialog can confirm a static RE**;
  and `[?]` attribution is a separate claim — a co-resident overlay holds its own backbuffer
  references, so "the outstanding ref was ours" needs its own falsifier (resize before your own RTV
  exists). *Look FIRST:* `docs/OVERLAY_CAPTURE_COEXIST.md` §6d.b + §9's CONDEMNED item 4.
  `memory/lesson_a_resize_bracket_is_load_bearing_not_bookkeeping.md`

- **A negative reported before the evidence finishes arriving is worse than no report.** 2026-08-23:
  a resize test was called "did NOT crash" off a single `Get-Process` returning alive — while UE was
  displaying its `LowLevelFatalError` modal and had not yet exited. The dialog reached the user three
  minutes later. Then the relaunch that continued the work **destroyed the crash log** (HOST has no
  `multivoid.prev.log`; CLIENT_1 does), so the decisive finding survived only because it had been
  grepped in-flight. This is the same class as marking a todo done on intention, and it recurred three
  times in one session (a task marked completed for a measurement never made; a `-dx12` rig named in a
  task title and never run; this). *Rule:* write the crash predicate DOWN before the run — **crash = a
  window titled `*crash*` OR process exit, polled over >= 30 s**, never one instantaneous liveness
  poll — and **preserve the artifact before doing anything that rotates it.**

- **A file-SHAPE assumption hides in PRESENCE TESTS and in PROSE, not just in the enumerator.**
  2026-08-23, migrating skins from one-pak-per-skin to one shared `scientists.pak`. The obvious break
  was the enumerator (`skin_registry.cpp:159` derives a skin's name from the pak file's **stem**), and
  it was not the dangerous one. **`PickRandomStarterSkin()` (`:84-99`) tests presence by asking the
  FILESYSTEM whether `<dir>/<name>.pak` is a regular file (`:98-99`)** — with a shared pak none exist,
  the candidate list is empty, and **every new identity silently falls back to `kDefaultSkinName`**
  (`skin_registry.h:36`). No crash, no WARN that reads as broken; "everyone is the same skin" looks
  like a content decision. That function contains no enumeration and never surfaces in a search for
  "how are skins listed". A tree-wide grep of the extension AND the directory name then found
  **11 surfaces, only 3 of them logic**: +2 **player-facing strings** that become false
  (`local_body.cpp:127`, and `skins_panel.cpp:52` — the F1 browser stating the retired rule AS the
  rule) and +6 **contract comments** (`skin_registry.h:8,40,62,68`, `protocol.h:944,2182`), which are
  what the next implementer reads. Fixing the logic alone ships a build whose own UI lies. I had
  written "three sites" into the doc BEFORE running that grep — a census claim is a claim.
  *Look FIRST:* when changing an artifact's on-disk shape, grep the extension **and** the directory
  name tree-wide, sort hits into logic / user-visible text / contract comments, fix all three classes
  together. **Invariant: presence is asked of the AUTHORITY ("is name X available?"), never of the
  filesystem ("does `<X>.ext` exist?")** — every direct `is_regular_file` on a derived path is a future
  break of this kind. Sub-trap: two of my own citations pointed at a changelog COMMENT rather than the
  definition; cite the definition, the comment is not the authority.

- **Census the present chain by FOLLOWING the jmp to its owner — a trampoline belongs to no module.**
  2026-08-23. `E9` at a hooked function points into a `MEM_PRIVATE` page the hook engine allocated, so
  "which module is this address in?" returns NOTHING and reads as unattributable. One more hop settles
  it: MinHook's relay is `FF 25 [rip+0]` + abs64 (the followJmp-immune form is `48 B8 <imm64> FF E0`) —
  read the pointer slot and a real module name appears. Measured this way in VotV: two patches ours,
  one `NahimicOSD.dll`. Second trap: **third-party injectors live in VENDOR folders**
  (`C:\ProgramData\A-Volute\...`), so a module filter matching only the BASENAME can never show them —
  which is exactly why `parse_dump.py` had hidden Nahimic from every earlier read of the 19:17 dump
  (filter widened to full-path + graphics/injector keys the same day). *Look FIRST:*
  `tools/debug/present_hook_census.py census <pid>` before installing any inline hook, and before
  concluding a coexistence crash is yours. Also read your CHOSEN seam's live bytes — an unpatched
  prologue is what turns "nobody else is on this seam" from a hope into a measurement.

- **The SAME distinction can be needed in BOTH directions, two terms apart — and the second
  direction is the one nobody asks about.** MEASURED 2026-07-31, GitHub issue #5. The fix existed
  because VotV delivers typed keys to its in-world screens through `WidgetInteraction` on a
  **VIRTUAL Slate user**, which `UWidget::HasKeyboardFocus()` (user 0) is structurally blind to —
  the virtual user had to become VISIBLE. The SAME commit then added `HasFocusedDescendants()` to
  the 1 Hz backstop, and that accessor is **ALL-USERS**: the permanently-resident screen widget
  (`ui_consolesAtlas_C`) keeps virtual-user focus forever because nothing clears it, so the scan
  latched `scan=1` and every text-consumable hotkey died for the session. The user reported it
  within the hour. IDA settles it — `HasFocusedDescendants` exec `0x1427130e0` takes **no user
  argument at all**; `HasUserFocusedDescendants` exec `0x1427132e0` steps the PlayerController and
  resolves PC -> LocalPlayer -> `ControllerId` -> Slate user index. The `User` variant is not a
  stricter version, it is the only one that can EXPRESS the question. **Look FIRST: when a fix
  turns on WHO/WHICH-ONE (which user / peer / thread / slot), audit every OTHER accessor in the
  same change for that axis — an accessor that takes no argument for the axis cannot answer about
  it, and "all-users" reads as a safe superset when for an EXCLUDING predicate it is the defect.
  Prefer a term re-derived from a value the game itself clears (`activeInterface`) over one that
  reads residual focus on an object that never leaves memory.**

- **Swallowing `WM_KEYDOWN` does NOT stop `WM_CHAR` — and `WM_CHAR` is layout-translated.**
  MEASURED 2026-07-31 inside our own `WndProcDetour`: `TranslateMessage` synthesises the char from
  the keydown in the PUMP, before `DispatchMessage` ever reaches your window procedure, so returning
  0 from the keydown cannot un-create the character. One physical `T` logged
  `KEYDOWN -> SWALLOWED by the T-chat hotkey [capture=0]`, then `CHAR 0x435 -> SWALLOWED by
  CaptureActive [capture=1]` — eaten by a DIFFERENT gate that the keydown handler had itself
  switched on by opening chat. And `0x435` is U+0435, Cyrillic `е`: the char carries the
  LAYOUT-translated character while the hotkey matches the VK, so **on a RU layout the key that
  opens chat is the key that types `е`** (same shape as VOTV binding `ConsoleKeys=Tilde` AND
  `ConsoleKeys=ё` to the `VK_OEM_3` we swallow). **Look FIRST: instrument the whole sequence for one
  press — KEYDOWN/KEYUP/CHAR/SYSKEY* with the gate state beside each — because message N+1 is often
  decided by a flag message N set. To stop a character, handle the CHAR message.**

- **A "keep the frame alive" predicate is worthless if a gate ONE LEVEL UP can still veto the draw.**
  2026-07-29: `hud::IsActive()` (`hud.cpp:304-309`) carries a `RevealActive()` clause added SPECIFICALLY
  so the chat history's 220 ms fade keeps getting frames — and `imgui_overlay.cpp:359` gates
  `hud::Render()` on `!PauseMenuOpen()` above it. ESC closes the chat AND opens the native pause menu on
  the same keydown (`:214` falls through deliberately), so `chat_view::Draw()` is not called at all: the
  fade draws ZERO frames, the pin release living inside `Draw()` never runs so `SetRetentionFrozen(true)`
  stays latched for the whole pause, and the ramp's own variables freeze mid-transition (resuming either
  flashes at full alpha minutes later or kills the NEXT open's fade-in via `Ramp`'s `target ==
  g_revealTo` early branch). Both gates are individually correct and neither mentions the other. **Look
  FIRST: when you add a predicate whose job is "keep rendering me", walk UP to the render call site and
  ask who else can decide not to call it. And never put a latch release, timer, or cross-module publish
  inside a draw function — release it where the CLOSE happens.** A function that may or may not be called
  is a fine renderer and a terrible state machine.

- **A net-delta array-diff POLL is the wrong tool for a DISCRETE user event** — it (a) LAGS the
  mirror by up to the poll interval and (b) SILENTLY DROPS any change that returns to the baseline
  within one window (fast spam nets to zero → never sent). Measured 2026-07-21 take-4: `desk_input`
  250 ms net-delta lost a spam polarity toggle (R2); `signal_sync`/`comp_sync` 1000 ms lagged the
  export/import list (R17); `laptop_sync` 250 ms power poll = slow PC-on (R7). Invisible in steady
  state → slips smoke; only fast input exposes it. Fix = capture at the native VERB edge (PE/Func
  hook), not "poll faster". Distinct from the transient-predicate poll lesson. *Look FIRST:* any Tick
  with a `kPoll*` interval + a `g_baseline` scalar/array diff; the take-4 findings doc.

  Func-patch `AudioComponent:Play` + `ActorComponent:SetActive/Activate` and pointer-whitelist the
  target COMPONENTS (the whitelist doubles as the owner filter: the laptop's same-named comps
  self-exclude). Func-visibility is decided by the CALLEE's NATIVENESS, never the call opcode —
  EX_VirtualFunction on a native target funnels through `UFunction->Func` (286-asset census, v115).

- **A test/automation bot drives at the human-INPUT seam, NEVER the effect seam** (2026-07-23, the
  Baritone-analog director DESIGN). Issue actions at the UFunctions a human's input hits
  (`AddMovementInput`, `InpActEvt_use`, forced `lookAtActor`), never the downstream mutator
  (`propInventory_C::takeObj` etc.). Driving INPUT makes the bot authority-equivalent to a human client,
  so the scenario runs the REAL detection->broadcast->authority path; driving the EFFECT mutates state
  locally and tests nothing (or fakes a bug). `take`/`grab`/`press` = "aim + input-verb" composition.
  Scope: callable input-seam UFunctions only (out: EX_Local-only/widget/analog-held/drag; resolve on the
  DECLARING class per the FindFunction trap). Anchor: `autotest_chippile` drives real InpActEvt_use through
  the real wire (v85 PASS). **REFINED 2026-07-23:** the "input seam only" ideal is fully achievable only for
  MOVEMENT; discrete input-ACTION verbs are inert via reflection (next row). *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_drive_test_bot_at_input_seam_not_effect_seam.md` + the director DESIGN §B4.
- **Discrete input-ACTION verbs are INERT via reflection; only movement input is input-seam-faithful**
  (2026-07-23, director green run). A `CallFunction` on a `mainPlayer_C` `InpActEvt_*` discrete verb
  (`InpActEvt_drop`, `InpActEvt_use`) fires the ProcessEvent OBSERVERS but does NOT run the BP body -- the
  engine drives the ubergraph from the real key press-edge, not the reflected stub (measured: hand still
  full 20 ticks after `InpActEvt_drop`; chippile found the same for the grab body). So a driving bot must
  "arm the observer (`InpActEvt_*`) + call the EFFECT verb" (`throwHoldingProp` / `door_C::doorOpen` /
  `playerGrabbed`), and say so honestly (`drop-input-seam-faithful=0`). ONLY `AddMovementInput` is a pure
  input-seam drive. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_discrete_input_action_verbs_inert_via_reflection.md` + the director DESIGN §6b.
- **A driven Character's movement input must land EVERY FRAME or friction brakes it to a crawl**
  (2026-07-23, director). `CharacterMovement` consumes+clears `ControlInputVector` per frame, so a
  worker-loop `AddMovementInput` at a 20ms tick (game ~9ms/frame) leaves most frames zero-input and VOTV's
  ground friction decelerates the body between pushes -> ~5cm/s "turtle"; `kTickMs=4` (2-3 inputs/frame) =
  full speed. `GT::Post` runs on the PE detour (~2050/fr) so the round-trip is sub-ms -- the Sleep was the
  bottleneck. Measure per-TICK displacement, not aggregate (a shove/respawn inflates the aggregate). *Look
  FIRST:* `memory/lesson_movement_input_must_land_per_frame.md` + the director DESIGN §6b.
- **A high-priority CLEANUP process must EXCLUDE the goal state from its activation** (2026-07-23,
  director). In a priority-arbitrated process system, a cleanup process on a raw predicate (ClearHand active
  when the hand is full) preempts + undoes a lower-priority goal process if the goal's SUCCESS satisfies the
  predicate: Grab put the grabbed clump in `grabbing_actor` -> ClearHand woke + dropped the goal clump. Gate
  the cleanup to exclude the goal-completion region (ClearHand active only out-of-range + `!grabbed`); give
  it the goal/blackboard so it can. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_cleanup_process_must_exclude_the_goal_state.md` + the director DESIGN §6b.
- **An engine with a baked NavMesh collapses a movement-bot's whole pathfinder** (2026-07-23). VOTV levels
  ship RecastNavMesh/NavMeshBoundsVolume as cooked-umap exports + NPCs pathfind via AIMoveTo, so a
  Baritone port DELETES A*+Moves+Movement+ActionCosts+chunk-cache and uses one engine call:
  `FindPathToLocationSynchronously` (controller-agnostic `UNavigationPath`) + per-tick `AddMovementInput`
  steering on the possessed player (NOT AIController MoveTo — that needs an AIController; mainPlayer_C =
  AddMovementInput x7 + CharacterMovement x82, AIMoveTo=0). Trap: navmesh ACTORS authored (umap export =
  measured) != navmesh BUILT+traversable (runtime HALT probe). *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_engine_navmesh_collapses_movement_bot_pathfinder.md` + the director DESIGN §A2/§B2.
- **SET-state syncs as VALUE-ops + a host-canonical container, never slot deltas** (v118 L8,
  2026-07-18). A native uniqueness gate (the plug dup-check) makes the positional-looking array a SET:
  slot-keyed deltas lose an element permanently on a concurrent same-slot race and diverge index-read
  layouts forever; value-ops (add/remove{value}) + the host's canonical full-container broadcast +
  drain-before-adopt + a deny/refund op make divergence structurally impossible. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_set_state_syncs_as_value_ops_plus_canonical.md` + `physmods_sync.cpp` (v118).

- **The HOST's organic change never rides the remote-op apply path** (v118 L8, 2026-07-18; BOTH
  audits independently). A remote-op apply assumes NOT-YET-APPLIED state -- the host's own organic
  change is already in its authoritative state, so self-routing it hits the dup/absent branches
  (a phantom refund spawn per host plug + no canonical broadcast). Host organic diff = broadcast
  canonical directly; only CLIENT ops ride the op path. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_host_organic_change_never_rides_the_remote_op_path.md` + DrainLocalDiff (v118).

- **A GEN GUARD decouples correctness from an INFERRED dispatch-visibility fact** (v117 L6,
  2026-07-18). When an edge-suppression rule hangs on unmeasured visibility (fin()'s PE dispatch was
  doctrine-inferred, live-unmeasurable pre-hands-on), don't prove-first (blocked) or ship-on-inference
  (the crutch class): make the mechanism NON-LOAD-BEARING — the session-start edge mints max(seen)+1,
  the end edge carries the gen it terminates, receivers drop stale/duplicate ends, starts apply
  unconditionally + realign. The inferred bracket demotes to spam suppression. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_gen_guard_decouples_inferred_visibility.md` + `deck_play_sync.cpp` (v117).

- **BP INNER calls (`EX_CallMath`/`EX_*`) BYPASS ProcessEvent** — a PE hook won't fire. THIRD instance
  2026-07-10: the T1 probe's PE-table interceptors on `Delay`/`K2_SetTimer*`/`SetActorTickInterval`/`QuitGame`
  were BLIND for a whole smoke (caught by its own positive control; moved to the Func-patch seam `7109efd1`).
  BONUS: a Func-patch POST hook's `sourceObject = FFrame::Object` = the CALLING BP actor — free per-caller
  attribution, no param stepping. FOURTH instance 2026-07-10 eve (the INVERSE trap): the STATIC dump
  `$type` cannot PREDICT visibility either way — garbagePile/pinecone read `EX_CallMath` yet measurably
  FIRE the PE POST; chipPile reads the same and doesn't. Only a live catch classifies a caller.
  *Look FIRST:* the dispatch map's MECHANISM row + its live-catch evidence, never the dump alone.

- **`R::FindFunction(cls, name)` is EXACT-OWNER — no SuperStruct climb**: a parent-class UFunction
  (AActor::SetLifeSpan) looked up on a BP leaf returns NULL every call + pays a futile full-array walk
  (audit CRITICAL 2026-07-10: the ambient-mirror lifespan backstop was silently dead). SECOND STRIKE
  2026-07-11: BOTH spawn-by-key sites resolved `setKey` on the LEAF wire class → prop_crowbar_C mirrors
  spawned keyless → field key diverged from the wire binding → pickup-destroys missed the host = the
  host-side crowbar DUPE (rocks masked it: a rock IS prop_C). THIRD STRIKE 2026-07-12: the take-3
  KEY-UNIQUENESS re-key silently no-opped — trashBitsPile_C's setKey lives on actor_save_C, outside the
  hardcoded Aprop_C fallback; fixed by `R::SuperStructOf` + a chain-climbing ResolveSetKeyFn
  (`460da7e4`) — reuse that resolver shape. Resolve on the DECLARING class + cache;

  per-class `addDamage`/`damageByPlayer`, ALL EX_Local-invisible inward from `attack`; the ONE
  Func-patchable choke is `VictoryFloatMinusEquals` (every prop+creature health write; FFrame::Object =
  target). A client's hits are LOCAL-ONLY today (user live 2026-07-11: zero damage cross-peer, silent

  NATIVE calls inside it. **Boundary sharpened 2026-07-13: this is THE ONLY remaining invisible class,
  and it's SOLVABLE (GNatives swap = a third hook primitive); EX_CallMath was NEVER part of the wall

  DisplayIndex@4, Number@8}`** — NOT `{CmpIdx, Number@4, Display@8}`. Shipping build: `CmpIdx==DispIdx`
  so bytes 0-7 read as the DUPLICATED index (`Init_904`=`0x0000038900000389`); real `Number` is `op[2]`
  (@byte 8), =0 for a clean verb name. Match `op[0]==StringToFName.ComparisonIndex && op[8]==Number` —
  raw bytes-0-7 vs an 8-byte FName NEVER matches (v1 probe's silent-miss). LIVE-measured; the probe-first
  STEP 1.0 caught it BEFORE the un-removable swap. *Look FIRST:* dump the live operand as THREE int32s,
  expect `op[0]==op[1]`. `memory/lesson_fscriptname_operand_layout_cmpidx_dispidx_number.md`
- **A guard/suppression that never LOGS is indistinguishable from one that never FIRES** — the client
  kerfur menu-cancel hooks the PE-VISIBLE menu entry, but the conversion verb is `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`
  (PE-invisible), so the cancel NEVER reached it (*"cancel/queue lines never appeared in any real session"*,
  `kerfur_convert.cpp:97,402`) — the client has been converting LOCALLY then reconciling after the fact, and
  that dead guard is the mechanism that made take-9-bug1 possible ("kerfur deleted on both peers"). THREE
  this session, same shape (dead cancel · Model-B eid-reuse [§3 said rebindInPlace, code mints per-form eids]
  · "the two-phase arm record" = actually FOUR converge mechanisms): the DOC describes intent, the CODE
  describes behavior, nobody diffed them. Instrument the SUPPRESSION path (one line on every fire); before
  building ON a documented mechanism, grep its fire-line in a real session to prove it RUNS. **INVERSE
  INSTANCE 2026-07-14 pm:** a no-log guard can be REACHED-BUT-DECLINING, not only never-fired — I read
  `TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy`'s zero log lines as "structurally dead" and nearly deleted it; it was reached
  on every client turn-on and declined SILENTLY (its no-qualified-B path logged nothing). Instrumenting the
  DECLINE path (not just suppress) revealed it. So instrument EVERY exit, not just success. *Look FIRST:*
  grep the guard's log line in a real log — no line = never fires OR silently declining; add it on the fire
  AND decline paths and find out which BEFORE building on it or deleting it. **SECOND INVERSE 2026-07-14 eve
  (log LIES the OTHER way):** `prop_lifecycle.cpp` Init POST logged `"HOST broadcasting SPAWN"`
  UNCONDITIONALLY, above the sole-express suppress gate — so a SUPPRESSED conversion still printed a broadcast
  that never happened; behavior right, log invented a failure, and it cost a detour chasing a phantom
  double-broadcast in the 20:20 take. Same root one layer down (log-SITE vs code-PATH): **a fire-line must be
  emitted from INSIDE the branch it describes — logging before a gate logs an INTENTION, not an event**, and an
  intention-log makes a working seam read as broken. Fixed `6b246201`.
  `memory/lesson_guard_that_never_logs_is_a_dead_guard.md`
- **A VM-dispatch bracket (GNatives-swap wrapper / self-bracket) runs MID-BYTECODE — do ZERO engine
  calls in that window** — capture data only (pointers, eids off a LIVE actor, class checks) + a pure DATA
  STORE (no engine dispatch); DEFER every engine call (register, park=ProcessEvent, broadcast, converge) to
  the deferred barrier. A nested ProcessEvent pump mid-verb corrupts (measured `kerfur_convert.cpp:11-20`;
  park=PE `kerfur.cpp:132`). **KERFUR MID-VERB STORE CORRECTED 2026-07-14 pm (DRAIN retired, measured-false):**
  the mid-verb store is just CAPTURING B (the successor actor pointer + index) — NO drain, NO repoint, NO
  migrate. The FINAL fix feeds that captured-B to the DEFERRED converge (`TryCaptureKerfurPropDestroy` /
  `ConvergeAfterConversion`), which does its normal per-form eid mint + KerfurId re-key UNCHANGED; only WHICH-B
  is fixed (see `[[project-vm-dispatch-2a-capture-2026-07-14]]`). Core discipline (zero engine mid-verb, defer to barrier)
  is reusable for the whole VM-consumer class (kerfur/melee/smart-items). *Look FIRST:*
  `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` §3 (SUPERSEDED banner points at the A+ spec).
  `memory/lesson_vm_bracket_zero_engine_mid_verb.md`
- **The kerfur conversion verbs are SYNCHRONOUS bodies (no latent node) — so the form spawn
  (`FinishSpawningActor`) AND the `K2_DestroyActor(self)` both fire INSIDE the 0x45 bracket, every
  toggle** → capture-in-window is sound. `dropKerfurProp` 30 stmts, `spawnKerfuro` 23 stmts, both
  standalone, whole-body latent scan = NONE, none between any `BeginDeferred`/`FinishSpawning`.
  [V] two ways: import-resolved body walk + 18/18 hands-on (`722fbe18`). This is the load-bearing 2a
  premise — settled, do NOT re-dig. *Look FIRST:* `research/findings/world-systems/votv-vm-dispatch-RE-2026-07-13.md`
  (body walk + runtime). `memory/lesson_kerfur_verbs_synchronous_capture_in_window.md`
- **When a design MIGRATES identity at birth, it must cover EVERY identity map keyed on the entity** —
  GENERAL principle, holds for any repoint/rebind/re-key. TRAP that made it: "the eid" is not the whole
  identity surface — the kerfur HOST has a SECOND table (`g_actorToKerfurId`/`KerfurRecord.actor`,
  `kerfur_entity.cpp:62-64`; client is eid-based, no KerfurId map) that an eid-only rebind does NOT re-key →
  mid-window KerfurId resolves DEAD-A while eid resolves LIVE-B (heisenbug). **KERFUR RESOLUTION CORRECTED
  2026-07-14 pm (drain retired): kerfur migrates NOTHING and DRAINS NOTHING at birth** — the eid is per-form
  + K stable (`kerfur_convert.cpp:188-258`), and the FINAL fix leaves the existing converge (per-form eid mint
  + KerfurId re-key) UNCHANGED, fixing only WHICH-B (feed the captured successor to the guard). So the 2nd-map
  heisenbug cannot arise — nothing is migrated at birth to go half-done. The GENERAL enumerate-every-map
  principle still holds for ANY design that DOES migrate. *Look FIRST:* grep the entity's
  id/type + enumerate every keyed map BEFORE any migration design; `[[project-vm-dispatch-2a-capture-2026-07-14]]`
  for the A+ resolution. `memory/lesson_identity_migrate_at_birth_covers_every_map.md`
- **Before installing a PERMANENT / un-removable seam (process-lifetime GNatives swap, never un-swapped),
  measure its real cost in a THROWAWAY removable probe FIRST** — including the ENABLED=false disabled path
  (the eternal tax the process pays forever) and a WORST-CASE frame, not idle. You can't roll back a
  permanent seam; the probe you can delete. (impl /qf: the gate-2.2 probe used a simpler filter → 0.013/
  0.038 was a LOWER bound, not the real-filter gate.) *Look FIRST:* `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` §2.0
  (STEP 1.0). `memory/feedback_probe_first_for_unremovable_seams.md`
- **A destroy-seam consult runs POST-destruction: engine reads on the dying actor return ZEROS** —
  `GetActorLocation` on it reads (0,0,0) (RootComponent gone) while class/name/key MEMORY reads still
  work, so a proximity matcher silently mis-filters (take-10: the capture never fired all session).
  AND: matcher decline paths must NEVER be silent — take-10's two unlogged declines cost a full test
  cycle to localize. Positions come from caches (watch/stamps/element rows), never live dispatches on
  the dying actor. *Look FIRST:* `docs/COOP_VM_DISPATCH_PLAN.md` (the superseding temporal-pairing
  design). `memory/lesson_post_destroy_seam_reads_zeros_and_silent_declines.md`
- **BP-JSON call censuses: text-grepping an export for a NATIVE fn name gives FALSE NEGATIVES** — imported
  callees are bare `StackNode` indices; resolve `Imports[-idx-1].ObjectName` first (2026-07-10 twice:
  updateHold "no attach", delEmail "removes=[]"). *Look FIRST:* the resolver pattern in
  `tools/rng_census_analyze.py`. `memory/lesson_bp_json_grep_resolve_imports.md`

- **An InputAction can have MULTIPLE delegate bindings — hook ALL.** `memory/lesson_input_action_multiple_delegate_bindings.md`
- **Every global `GetAsyncKeyState` hotkey poller gates on `!IsOverlayCapturingText()` too** — else it
  fires while the user types in chat (T then G triggered voice). `memory/lesson_hotkey_pollers_gate_on_overlay_text_capture.md`
- **A gated probe that "didn't fire": FIRST verify the GATE reads true.** `memory/lesson_gated_probe_verify_the_gate.md`
- **BP dynamic-multicast delegate UNBIND from C++ is an UNPROVEN capability here** (zero
  `RemoveDynamic`/`Unbind`/`ClearDelegate` in-tree) — before designing "suppress a BP event by killing its
  delegate handler", PROVE the unbind (layout RE + probe); it's a BUILD GATE. Prefer the proven
  caller-neutralization (disable a ticker / zero an array) or host-authoritative state.
  `memory/lesson_bp_delegate_unbind_unproven_capability.md`
- **A completion latch makes every LATE registrant a SILENT no-op.** `vm_dispatch`'s
  `TickResolvePending` opened with `if (g_allResolved) return;` — read as "stop re-trying", it was a
  PROCESS-lifetime latch, so a verb registered after the first "all N resolved" moment was never
  FName-resolved and its callback never fired. Every signal said success: registration returned
  `true`, the consumer's own banner printed, the verb even appeared in the log with a slot number.
  Cost TWO RED hands-on takes, both mis-attributed (first to entity identity, then to a whole
  delivery-pipeline RE with a wrong root) because the lane's code was never reached. The trigger was
  ORDERING: it was the tree's first consumer to register from `Tick()` instead of install time.
  Fixed `3027aeed` (registration clears the latch — per-PASS, not per-process).
  *Look FIRST:* a callback that "is registered" but never fires — prove it ENTERED before
  re-deriving any domain root; compare the timestamp of the substrate's "all N resolved / ARMED"
  line against your own "registered" line. Any `if (allDone) return;` in a subsystem that accepts
  dynamic registration is this bug waiting for its first late registrant.

- **A UMG click handler gated on HOVER state no-ops via a bare reflected call — set the hover + drive
  the BOUND slot, don't fall back to the effect seam.** `uicomp_playerInvContainerSlot::pressButton`
  (the container-slot click handler) has bytecode that calls `setHoverContainerSlot(self)` on its Owner
  UI + references `IsHovered`, so the take is keyed on which slot the UI considers HOVERED. A reflected
  `CallFunction` moves no mouse → `pressButton` returned `true` and took NOTHING (count unchanged) when
  driven on a stray `uicomp_playerInvContainerSlot_C` with no hover set. Fix (measured, count 2→0):
  drive `ui.slots_prop[i]` (the UI's OWN bound slot) after `ui.setHoverContainerSlot(slot)` — NOT the
  effect-seam `prop_container::extract(Index)` (which drives a seam a human never touches, breaking
  authority-equivalence). `em_take`/`makeSelected` are PLAYER-side, not the container take. The UMG
  analog of the input-inert trap; verify by the state DELTA, never the call's return.
  *Look FIRST:* driving any VOTV UMG widget action by reflection — read its click-handler bytecode
  (kismet-analyzer `to-json` on the `.uexp`) for an `IsHovered`/hover/selection gate, satisfy that
  state, drive the parent's bound child (`slots_*`), not a stray instance. Pairs with
  `[[lesson-discrete-input-action-verbs-inert-via-reflection]]` +
  `[[lesson-findfunction-does-not-walk-the-superclass-chain]]` (containers are a class family; the
  verbs live on the base `prop_container_C`). `memory/lesson_umg_click_handler_gated_on_hover_state.md`

- **A CATCH-ALL KEY HANDLER IS A TRANSPORT, NOT A BIND.** Measured 2026-07-31 from `mainPlayer`'s
  ubergraph: the `AnyKey` input events BROADCAST `anyKeyEvent`, call `intComs_anyKey`, and forward
  the key into `WidgetInteraction.PressKey/ReleaseKey/PressPointerKey/ReleasePointerKey` — i.e.
  `AnyKey` is the transport by which typing reaches **in-world 3D widgets**, and it consumes
  nothing. Both obvious readings are wrong for the same reason: treat it as binding everything and
  no key is ever free (the feature becomes impossible); dismiss it as noise and you lose the only
  path keys take to those widgets. The consequence that matters: a widget fed by **injection**
  rather than by Slate focus may be **invisible to a `HasKeyboardFocus` predicate** — exactly the
  *"might be other game systems"* the user hedged about. *Look FIRST:* classify a handler by what it
  DOES with the input (consumes / relays / observes), never by how much of it it sees; decode
  before excluding. Decode path: `research/bp_reflection/<asset>.json` + `kdec.py`; the
  `InpActEvt_*` stubs only set a temp and jump, so grep the decoded ubergraph for that temp — and
  note the JSON carries **no statement offsets**, so `range=` filtering silently passes everything.

- **2026-08-22 — two inline hook engines on ONE function collide via PolyHook's `followJmp`; the
  WP-2 UE4SS-lane boot crash was a ProcessEvent DOUBLE-DETOUR.** UE4SS 3.0.1 hooks
  `UObject::ProcessEvent` too — LAZILY (first `Unreal::Hook::RegisterProcessEventPreCallback`; its PE
  dispatcher `UE4SS.dll+0x554da0`, NOT printed in UE4SS.log like the two `<- Built-in` lines —
  **absence of a log line ≠ absence of the hook**). When UE4SS's PolyHook `x64Detour::hook()` runs
  AFTER our MinHook, its `followJmp` follows our `E9` into our MinHook RELAY, and because the relay is
  an INDIRECT `ff25[rip]` it resolves `m_fnAddress` to the relay's POINTER slot (tramp+0x1A) and
  writes its target-patch THERE, clobbering `&ProcessEventDetour` → a non-canonical `jmp` → `#GP` →
  `AV read -1`. MEASURED: **install-order is NOT the variable — we are always-first (20/20 boots)**;
  whether UE4SS's LAZY PE hook ARMS is (0/15 solo, ~2/10 two-peer runs). Impossible on the proxy lane
  (no PolyHook in-process). LOOK FIRST: a crash RIP inside a MinHook trampoline on the UE4SS lane →
  read the relay abs64 at `tramp+0x1A` in a `-fullcrashdump`; who-hooked-first = what OUR trampoline
  HOLDS (real prologue `40 55 56 57 41 54` = us first). **Fix DECIDED (2026-08-22) = B** (followJmp-immune
  relay: `ff25[rip]` → `mov rax,imm64; jmp rax`, so followJmp stops on the `mov` and PolyHook cleanly
  in-place-hooks the relay → both detours chain); **C ruled out** (UE4SS's PE PreCallback returns `void`,
  can't host our ~20 native-call interceptors → we always own our PE detour, B is permanent). **VERIFIED
  2026-08-22 eve (commit `0c14a931`)** — real-env trampoline byte decode (PolyHook in-place-hooked our
  immune relay mid-session; 80 s crash-free) + a DEV boot printing `POLYHOOK-COMPOSED`+`WE-FIRST`.
  SUB-LESSON (same day): the pe_diag classifier's first-match scan read **MinHook's own jump-back stub**
  (`FF25 00000000`+abs64→PE+6, which PRECEDES the relay in the trampoline slot and shares the legacy
  relay's encoding) as "the relay" → printed LEGACY-CORRUPT on EVERY boot regardless of reality; only
  the payload (`==&detour`) discriminates the relay from the jump-back — locate once at the install
  snapshot, classify that offset thereafter. Also: UE4SS 3.0.1 stable in the DEV stack armed its PE hook
  <10 s with NO ArmPE fixture — the "lazy, 0/15 solo" measurement does not generalize across stacks.

- **2026-08-22 — a coexisting VEH crash-reporter mod (CrashContext) pre-empts our SEH-guarded fault
  tolerance.** Our `ue_wrap::reflection::IsLive()` (`reflection.cpp:165`) SEH-guards the read of a
  possibly-dangling `UObject*` and returns false on a fault (deliberate; silent for months). But
  `Moddy-CrashContext` installs an `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`, and **VEH fires BEFORE frame-based
  `__except`**, so it catches our normally-absorbed fault first and pops a crash report. Measured:
  exit-to-menu AV at `main.dll+0x11CC78` = `IsLive` (resolved via the build `.map`), only WITH
  CrashContext present. NOT a bug in IsLive; a Windows exception-ordering coexistence trap. **SHARPENED
  2026-08-22 eve by measurement: it is a FALSE-crash (popup + report), not a crash** — CrashContext has
  NO TerminateProcess/ExitProcess/MiniDump/`__fastfail` imports (byte-scan), the process survived (2nd
  report 9 s later, no UE dump), and faults manifest only when the freed page is DECOMMITTED (DEV runs
  silently clean). LOOK FIRST: an AV whose RIP is in a function you SEH-guard that only reproduces WITH
  other mods → grep their imports for `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`. FIX: the zero-AV discipline —
  design of record `research/findings/tooling/votv-islive-zeroav-cachedobjref-DESIGN-2026-08-22.md`

- **2026-08-22 — the ProcessEvent double-detour crash is CONFIG-DEPENDENT, not universal.** It fires
  only if something ARMS UE4SS's PE inline detour via `RegisterProcessEventPreCallback` — and NO stock
  mod does (measured: not DebugMod/CrashContext/PBMovement, not jsbLuaProfiler, no UE4SS built-in; grep
  `reference/RE-UE4SS/assets/Mods/`). UE4SS hooks ProcessInternal/LocalScriptFunction/BeginPlay and
  RESOLVES PE's address but installs NO PE detour without a callback registration. The arm = a Lua mod
  calling `ExecuteInGameThread(fn, 0)` (ProcessEvent method, non-default) OR Multivoid's own MP/join
  path (the ~2/10 trigger). So the common modded stack coexists crash-free. LOOK FIRST: to reproduce,
  drop the `ArmPE` fixture; to predict, grep the stack for `RegisterProcessEventPreCallback`.

- **A `vm_dispatch` verb NAME is not a gate, and the verb ID is a PROJECT-WIDE namespace.** The 0x45
  substrate matches on the name alone -- its header says the class/authority check is "the CONSUMER's
  job" -- and `[V]` `playerHandUse_LMB` is declared by **146 classes** (knife, hacksaw, flamethrower,
  garbage gun, disintegrator, toolgun...). A v137 consumer gated only on `av.verbId` and would have let
  a client mint coins by destroying a prop with ANY tool; ten `/qf` rounds passed it because the design
  said Context-gated and only the code didn't. Ids collide too: `1` was already used by four modules,
  since `CurrentThreadVerb()` is one global thread-local. LOOK FIRST: grep the `CXXHeaderDump` for how
  many classes declare the verb, gate on `av.ctx`'s class in the SAME function that tests the id, and
  census `kVerb* =` across the tree before picking one. `drive_sync.cpp:47` and
  `container_contents_sync` already did this correctly.
  **THIRD MEMBER 2026-08-24 (`/qf` 46-47) — the AMBIENT read, where `active` is worse than the id.**
  The first two members were consumers reading the `Bracket` handed to their OWN callback (scoped, and
  always correct). `CurrentThreadVerb()` is different: it is a project-wide namespace. `[V]`
  `kerfur_form_assembler`'s six gates tested **`av.active` ALONE** — true for ANY registered verb — so a
  foreign bracket inverted them twice over: an unrelated spawn counted as a kerfur form spawn, and
  `reqScope = !av.active && InReqScope()` went FALSE, blinding the CallFunction route. `[V]` testing the
  id would not have saved it: `container_contents_sync`'s `kVerbDirty`, `meadow_db_sync`'s `kVerbMark`
  and `drive_sync`'s `kVerbPutDriveIn` are all **1** = kerfur's `kVerbTurnOff`, and `kVerbPulledOut = 2`
  is its `kVerbTurnOn`. `[V]` **the substrate already owned the unique handle and was not publishing
  it** — `RegisterVirtualVerb` requires the NAME to have static lifetime and the table stores that
  pointer — so `ActiveVerb` now carries `verbName` (~4 lines) and kerfur routes all six gates through
  one `InKerfurVerb()` (commit `0361b815`). `[V]` **severity as measured, not feared: LATENT** — the
  field run's session-end `CONTAINMENT SUMMARY` reads `catch{off=0 on=0}` on both peers. LOOK FIRST: an
  ambient "what am I inside" window is a CROSS-MODULE namespace, so gate on something unique by
  construction; `active` is never a gate. Contract: `docs/COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md` "The AMBIENT verb
  window". `memory/lesson_vm_dispatch_verb_name_is_not_the_gate.md`

- **A "cannot" in a comment is a snapshot of what was TRIED, not a property of the substrate.** `[V]`
  `ui/multiplayer_menu.h:13` justified every polled click in this codebase with *"a reflection-only DLL
  cannot bind the `UButton::OnClicked` FMulticastScriptDelegate (no UObject+UFunction to point it at)"*.
  True as an account of what had been built -- census 2026-08-25 finds **zero** `FScriptDelegate` /
  `InvocationList` code in the tree -- and read for months as an architectural fact, until a USER
  question forced the re-derivation. Every link was already there: `OnClicked` is a plain
  `TArray<FScriptDelegate>` @ **+0x3C8, size 0x10** (`UMG.hpp:284`, with `OnPressed`/`OnHovered`/
  `OnUnhovered` beside it); a delegate-dispatched event is **already PE-VISIBLE and our own map says
  so** (`COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY.md:81`, the game's own inventory buttons, marked "expected"); and all
  five primitives were **already public in our own headers** -- `InternalIndexOf` + `SlotSerial`,
  `EngineAlloc`, `StringToFName` (`fname_utils.h:24`), `RegisterInterceptor` with cancel-on-true
  (`game_thread.h:86,124`). Interceptors key on the **UFunction**, so N sink objects share one function
  name and are told apart by `self` -- no authored asset, no editor. The false premise had already
  propagated into a build plan and nearly bought an entire UE-editor toolchain. LOOK FIRST: **read the
  clause after the "cannot"** -- if it names an ARTIFACT WE LACK ("no X to point it at") it is a backlog
  item wearing a limit's clothes; if it names a MECHANISM THAT DOES NOT EXIST (measured-invisible
  dispatch) it is a real limit. And **a zero-hit census is evidence about US, not the engine**: "we have
  never done X" and "X is impossible" grep identically. Status `[RD]` -- links measured, composition
  NEVER RUN. `docs/MULTIPLAYER_UI.md` 6e.

- **2026-08-26 -- A HOOKING LIBRARY'S "original function" OUT-PARAM IS ITS TRAMPOLINE, AND FREEING
  IT CORRUPTS BEFORE IT UNMAPS.** `[V]` `minhook/src/hook.c:634` `*ppOriginal = pHook->pTrampoline`;
  `[V]` `buffer.c:43-50` MEMORY_SLOT UNIONs its free-list link with the trampoline bytes, so
  `buffer.c:282`'s `pSlot->pNext = ...` writes eight bytes AT OFFSET 0 of the slot -- inside
  `MH_RemoveHook` (`hook.c:702`), i.e. the corruption is IN PLACE and the later `VirtualFree` is a
  SECOND hazard. A 2026-05-27 audit cleared the resulting use-after-free by reading the variable's
  NAME (`g_originalPE`) and concluding it aimed at a process-lifetime engine entry point -- which is
  how `hook.h:45-48` ("Disable is the ONLY safe retirement") sat FIVE LINES from `hook.h:56`
  ("...uninitialize. Safe to call once at shutdown") for four months. Also false: "we have ~12 hooks
  so the block stays alive" -- MinHook allocates near the target, so ProcessEvent's trampoline had
  its OWN block and removing that one hook released the page. LOOK FIRST: any `void**` out-param
  from a hooking library is memory the LIBRARY owns -- find the assignment in ITS source, never
  reason from the name your code gave it; use Disable, never Remove, for a detour anything may be
  entering; and a crash whose faulting ADDRESS equals a logged `trampoline <base>` line IS this bug
  (second such match in this project -- see the 2026-08-22 row in section 8).

- **2026-08-26 -- AN UNTESTABLE PATH HIDES MORE THAN THE RESIDUAL YOU KNOW ABOUT.** `[V]` `mp.py`'s
  `kill_all()` was `Stop-Process -Force` = TerminateProcess, so no `WM_CLOSE` and no
  `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` -- the whole shutdown path had NEVER executed under any automated scenario, on
  any build. The instrument built to falsify ONE known residual instead found, on its first two runs:
  that the rig composes with UE4SS's PolyHook unprompted (a doc had been read for days as saying the
  opposite), a 3-second window to DETACH, and a LIVE use-after-free unrelated to the residual. A path
  no test walks accumulates claims nobody can check -- its comments are un-refuted, not true. LOOK
  FIRST: ask "has this path ever executed in a test?" before estimating its risk, and read HOW the rig
  terminates (a forced kill silently deletes every teardown path from coverage); build the instrument
  BEFORE the fix and give it a RED arm; and budget for it finding something else.

- **A shared CONFIG store defeats per-copy isolation, and a persisted loss INCRIMINATES your mod.**
  `[V]` 2026-08-29: `forward` vanished from the machine's keybind file and presented as "all peers
  can't move forward". `deploy-all.ps1` promises each game copy its OWN `Saved/`; measured, every
  copy's `Saved/Config/` is **EMPTY** and the effective config is ONE shared
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VotV\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\` — shared with every other VotV install on the
  box (a Desktop copy, the r2modman profile) because no launcher passes a user-dir switch. So "ALL
  peers" was one file with four readers, not a systematic code defect. **The control test made it
  worse, not better:** removing the mod did not restore W, because the loss was on disk — and a
  control that cannot clear PERSISTENT state converts an exoneration into an accusation. Free cam
  kept working throughout (`freecam.cpp:53` reads `GetAsyncKeyState`, the physical key, never the
  binding table), which was misread as "the key reaches the game, so movement is at fault". LOOK
  FIRST: for any "input/settings wrong on every peer" report, diff `Input.ini`'s `ActionName=` list
  against the cooked `DefaultInput.ini` BEFORE reading a line of our code. Two residuals stay open:
  peer config is not isolated (so no per-peer settings result from this rig is trustworthy), and
  nothing in the rig ever presses a movement KEY — `navprobe` drives a reflected `AddMovementInput`
  that bypasses the binding table, which is exactly why it stayed green while forward was dead.
  `memory/lesson-a-shared-config-store-defeats-per-copy-isolation.md`

- **VOTV's movement is ACTION mappings, not axes — a generic-UE4 clearing did not apply.** `[V]`
  2026-08-29: the game declares exactly TWO axis mappings in total (`mouseX`, `mouseY`,
  `DefaultInput.ini:162-163`); `forward`/`back`/`left`/`right`/`jump`/`run` are all ActionMappings.
  A doc had cleared our `InpActEvt_*` interceptors as movement suspects with "movement in UE is an
  AXIS, not an action event" — true of UE4 in general, FALSE for this game, so the suspect was never
  actually cleared. It survives re-clearing only on measured ordinals (ours 38/41/42, 58/59, 13/14,
  2/3, 0/1 vs movement's 26-37). LOOK FIRST: these are cooked BP names whose
  `_K2Node_InputActionEvent_<N>` suffix is a GLOBAL node ordinal — a recook that inserts one node
  renumbers the tail, and a failed resolve is loud while a resolve to the WRONG function is silent.
  `memory/lesson-a-shared-config-store-defeats-per-copy-isolation.md`

**A harness that owns the input path can deny it to the thing it measures.** The native browser's close button read "not hit-testable" for three days; our own `SetCursorPosDetour` was returning TRUE without calling through, because `CaptureActive()` was held by a `config_review` modal armed from a dead ini key. `SetCursorPos` asked (1280,711), returned `ok=1 err=0` with the clip rect the whole desktop, and the pointer stayed at client (0,0) -- so the full-screen scrim read hovered and everything inside the window did not, which is exactly the signature of a broken hit test. Three causes were proposed and falsified before the write was ever read back. **Look here FIRST:** a test that SYNTHESIZES input must assert it OWNS the input path, not just the foreground -- `imgui_overlay::CaptureOwners()` names the holder in one line; and always write-then-read-back a cursor position in a process that hooks `SetCursorPos`. [[lesson-a-harness-that-owns-the-input-path-can-deny-it-to-what-it-measures]]

- **HAND-WRITTEN CLEANUP LANDS ON THE BRANCH YOU WERE LOOKING AT — USE A GUARD.** 2026-08-31, user bug
  report ("voice chat imgui X cross not closing the window ... it still closes by its hotkey - V").
  `voice_panel.cpp` bridged the atomic `g_open` through a local `bool open` for `ImGui::Begin`'s
  close-X. The write-back existed on the `!s.enabled` early-out — the RARE branch nobody runs — and
  NOT on the normal tail, so for every real player the X set `open=false`, nothing read it, and the
  next frame re-opened the window. V worked because it drives `g_open` directly. The comment above it
  asserted "both early-out and tail paths"; the comment was the only place that was true. *Look FIRST:*
  a value that must be written back on EVERY exit gets a destructor, not a copy per `return`; and audit
  the COMMON path first — the exceptional branch is where the author's eyes were and is likeliest correct.

## 5. Engine / UE4 facts

- **A FULLY-RESOLVED IMPORT TABLE PROVES THE BIND STEP, NOT THE LOAD — never write "it loads" from pefile alone; the implication only runs the other way.** `[V]` 2026-09-02 (the Relay study's audit, finding M1): "all 187 imports resolve against the pin" had been written as `[V]` "Relay loads beside Multivoid today" — but import completeness proves only that symbol-bind succeeds; DllMain, static initializers (41.8 MB of static `.data` in that DLL) and the mod entrypoint can all still fail, and nothing executed the load. The INVERSE stays sound: a missing import guarantees `ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND` — provably dead, which is what makes the 46/187-on-stable claim legitimate. **Look here FIRST:** the asymmetry rule for prerequisite censuses (imports, exports, config keys, assets): absence of a required input = provably cannot run; presence of all inputs earns "nothing at that layer blocks it", never a runtime verb, until an executed run with its log. [[lesson-resolved-imports-prove-binding-not-loading]]

- **`FindObjectByClass` CAN RETURN A DEAD WORLD'S ACTOR -- it has no liveness test and no world filter, and the OLD instance wins by index.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: a user hosted, quit to the menu, hosted a DIFFERENT map, and a client joining the instant the lobby appeared got a **1284-byte "host world"** and kept its own (two ATVs, every door disagreeing). `save_capture` had resolved `mainGamemode` this way and run `saveObjects` on the gamemode of the world the host had just left. A post-ship audit hexdumped the surviving file: a structurally COMPLETE GVAS save with its terminator intact -- NOT a torn write, which is the mechanism my first fix chased. It also explains the puzzle in that commit (the capture logged 2,197 live keyed props at the same instant: our tracker walks GUObjectArray and found the NEW world). **CENSUS the same day, 136 call sites outside `reflection.cpp`: ~52 are world-scoped and exposed** -- 30 mainGamemode, 8 `MainPlayerClass`, **6 `DaynightCycleClass`** (the weather lane; the fog-in-the-menu bug is still open), 3 `SuperFogClass`, 3 `UiMenuClass`, 2 `kBlackScreenClass`; NOT exposed are `GameInstanceClass` (immortal), `WorldClass` (use `CurrentWorld()`), and asset/CDO lookups. **Exactly one is scoped today.** **Look here FIRST:** the census lives in `ue_wrap/engine/world_identity.h` as a triage list -- the per-site question is "can this run across a world change?", and if yes compare `WorldOf(candidate)` against `CurrentWorld()`, remembering a NULL stamp is not a rejection. When a capture or transfer produces something structurally valid but semantically EMPTY, ask which INSTANCE it read before assuming the write failed. [[lesson-findobjectbyclass-can-return-a-dead-worlds-actor]]

- **SAMPLE A THROTTLE BEFORE THE PROBE THAT REFRESHES IT.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `client_model`'s `ResolveCached` returns null WITHOUT asking inside a 5 s window, and refreshes `lastTryMs` when it DOES ask and fail. A predicate that probed and then asked "was that throttled?" therefore always saw "throttled" -- so it answered `Unknown` for a genuinely absent asset forever and `No` never, and a host whose ini named a missing pak neither degraded nor told the player. Sampling first fixed that and exposed the sequel: the verdict then alternated `No -> Unknown -> No` on the throttle, and the worn body with it, telling the player **12 times in a 30 s smoke** (the user reported it independently while the measurement was on screen). **Look here FIRST:** before asking a cache whether it declined, check whether the call you just made writes the field you are about to read. A tri-state whose third value means "ask again later" needs a STICKY per-subject verdict, or the output oscillates at the throttle's period; and count the user-visible effect in a smoke (12 vs 1) -- reading the code found neither half. [[lesson-sample-a-throttle-before-the-probe-that-refreshes-it]]

- **A SAVE / CALL-A-UFUNCTION / RESTORE SEQUENCE NEEDS RAII: the fault unwinds straight past your restore line.** `[V]` 2026-09-01, found by a post-ship audit in code I had just shipped. `reflection::CallFunction` calls `g_processEvent` bare -- no SEH of its own -- and the nearest `__except` is the posted-task / detour boundary, which unwinds PAST a trailing restore. The shut survives, the restore never runs. What made it severe rather than untidy: the field was `Atrigger_lightRoot_C::active`, which is SAVE-PERSISTENT, so the leak is written into the player's save and follows them into single-player -- every switch in that group flips, clicks, and moves no light, permanently. That is the KO-ragdoll class again. **Look here FIRST:** the image is built `/EHa` and `pe_detour.cpp` says so explicitly (the `__except` unwind still runs C++ destructors), which is exactly what makes a scope guard correct here; ask what the field's LIFETIME is before judging a leak (grep the class's `getTriggerData`/`loadTriggerData`); and ASSERT the restore after the scope closes rather than trusting the destructor ran. [[lesson-a-save-restore-around-a-ufunction-call-needs-raii]]

- **A WRITE THAT FAILS CLOSED CAN LEAVE THE GUARD BUILT ON IT FAILING OPEN.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `SetGroupGate` correctly refused to write through an unresolved offset, and `GetGroupGate` correctly reported the authored default when it could not read -- and the guard composed from them then silently did NOTHING, reinstating the two-writer defect it existed to prevent. No log, no degraded marker. Fail-closed is a property of the WRITE; what the caller depends on is a property of the SUPPRESSION, and those point in opposite directions. Sharpened by irony: refusing to write through a hardcoded fallback offset is the exact objection that declined a community PR the same session. **Look here FIRST:** whenever a primitive can no-op, ask what the CALLER concluded from the call; export availability as its own question rather than inferring it from a getter's default; and have the guard READ ITS OWN WRITE BACK -- one line that turns a silent inversion into a warning. [[lesson-a-write-that-fails-closed-can-leave-a-guard-failing-open]]

- **`PendingKill` alone means GC NEVER CLAIMED IT -- read the destruction STAGE, not one bit.**
  `[V]` 2026-09-01. `IsLive` collapses `PendingKill | Unreachable` into a boolean, which is right
  for a liveness gate and useless for a diagnosis. The stages are separately observable:
  `FUObjectItem::Flags` @slot+0x08 carries `PendingKill` 1<<29 (a TEARDOWN set this, not the
  collector) and `Unreachable` 1<<28 (GC has claimed it); `UObject::ObjectFlags` @obj+0x08 carries
  `RF_BeginDestroyed` 1<<15 (purge phase 1 ran) and `RF_FinishDestroyed` 1<<16 (phase 2 ran). The
  leaked world read `int=20000000 rf=0028000B` -- PendingKill and nothing else, neither destroy
  flag -- so `BeginDestroy` had never run and GC was finding it REACHABLE every pass. That one
  read **falsified a hypothesis three documents had already recorded** as "the reading that fits
  every measurement" (a `FinishDestroy` deferred on the render `FScene`); it fit because nothing
  had ever measured the two apart. *Look FIRST:* before theorising about why an object will not go
  away, print its stage flags -- `RF_BeginDestroyed` absent means go hunt a REFERENCE, present-with-
  `RF_FinishDestroyed`-absent means it really is stuck in phase 2. Accessor:
  `reflection::InternalFlagsOf`; values confirmed against `reference/RE-UE4SS/.../FlagsStringifier.hpp`.
  [[lesson-pendingkill-alone-means-gc-never-claimed-it]]

- **One `AddToRoot`'d actor keeps its whole UWorld alive, through the OUTER chain.** `[V]`
  2026-09-01. UE nulls a strong UPROPERTY reference whose target is `PendingKill` (which is why an
  ordinary dead-but-referenced actor still collects), but it does NOT eliminate the structural
  refs every UObject carries -- `Outer`, `Class`, `Name`. So `rooted actor --Outer--> ULevel
  --OwningWorld--> UWorld` drags the entire world out of every collection. 871 rooted proxies held
  one; released, the same census reads 0 and the world is gone within one interval. *Look FIRST:*
  to find what holds a dead world, walk every object's OUTER chain -- and **never resolve world
  membership through a field the failure has already nulled**, which is how the first holder census
  reported a confident `0` at every frame (it asked `WorldOf(o) == deadWorld`, and `WorldOf` reads
  the very `PersistentLevel` that is already null). Cross-check the count against your own logs: the
  holder count 871 and `grep -c "trash_proxy: SPAWN"` 871 is an attribution, not a correlation.
  [[lesson-a-rooted-actor-anchors-its-whole-world-through-outer]]

- **A cleanup gated on liveness is skipped exactly at the teardown that needed it.** `[V]`
  2026-09-01, the rejoin crash's real root. `if (liveActor) { DestroyActor(liveActor);
  RemoveFromRoot(liveActor); }` -- two operations, different preconditions, one guard. Destroying
  needs a live actor; **un-rooting does not, and un-rooting a dead object is the whole point.** At a
  world teardown `CachedObjRef::Alive()` is false on both its terms independently (slot PendingKill,
  stamped world no longer current), so the branch never ran and 871 actors stayed rooted -- while
  the log said `retired 871 proxy mirror(s)`. The shape is a false negative wherever it appears:
  `if (still valid) release()` disables the release in its own worst case, and it is disguised as
  defensive programming so review waves it through. Two comments in the tree already asserted the
  correct property (`reflection.h` "pairs with AddToRoot on EVERY teardown"; `subsystems.cpp`
  "structural no-leak") three lines from the `if` that broke it. *Look FIRST:* when one `if` covers
  several operations, ask what EACH requires and move the guard onto the one that needs it. Then
  **give the resource an owner** -- `ue_wrap::GcPin` releases from its destructor, held by value in
  the structure that owns the engine object, so erasing the structure IS the release. Add the
  counter the hand-written form could not (`GcPin::ReportWorldScopedPins`), and keep the raw pair
  from returning (`tools/gc/gc_pin_gate.ps1`, in CI).
  [[lesson-a-cleanup-gated-on-liveness-is-skipped-exactly-at-teardown]]

- **`UEngine::LoadMap` will hand `SetGameMode` a world with no `WorldSettings`, and it dies at
  `[null+0x268]`.** `[V]` 2026-08-31, the user's rejoin crash, reproduced autonomously
  (`mp.py reloadchurn --rejoin`, same `PCallStackHash` as their minidump, 3/3). The chain is
  `UEngine::Browse` -> UE4SS's LoadMap detour (it hooks `LoadMap` by default) -> `UEngine::LoadMap`
  -> `UGameInstance::CreateGameModeForURL`, whose first act is
  `InWorld->GetWorldSettings()->DefaultGameMode`. `[V]` `UWorld::PersistentLevel` @0x30,
  `ULevel::WorldSettings` @0x258, `AWorldSettings::DefaultGameMode` @**0x268** -- the fault address
  exactly. In a SHIPPING build `ULevel::GetWorldSettings`'s `checkf` is compiled out, so a null is
  returned silently and dereferenced one frame up. **What makes it OURS is the negative control, not
  the stack** (Multivoid appears nowhere in it): solo, the previous gameplay world is fully purged
  14 s after reaching the menu; with a coop session it is left kill-flagged with `PersistentLevel`
  already NULL and **never purges** -- 75 s of dwell and a forced `CollectGarbage` both fail to
  clear it -- and the next `open untitled_1` adopts that husk. *Look FIRST:* a crash inside a second
  in-process map load is about what the FIRST teardown left behind, and the place to look is the
  object array at the menu, not the load. **ANSWERED AND FIXED 2026-09-01 (RE doc section 9): the
  husk was not stuck mid-purge, it was still REACHABLE** -- 871 of our own GC-rooted trash-proxy
  actors anchored it through their Outer chain, because their un-root was written inside
  `if (liveActor)`. Repro is now a regression gate and passes. Full RE:

  [[lesson-loadmap-adopts-an-unpurged-world]]

- **A one-way LATENT chain cannot be undone by clearing the flag it also sets.** `[V]` bytecode
  2026-08-31: VOTV's player death is `dead := true` **plus** `RetriggerableDelay(5 s)` -> black
  screen -> `RetriggerableDelay(5 s)` -> `loadLevel('menu')` (uber `@37412` / `@4353` / `@4277`).
  The flag is a SYMPTOM the chain leaves behind; the chain is armed in the latent-action manager
  and **neither delay ever re-reads it**. A KO-respawn lane shipped on the claim "the same function
  that set `dead` clears it" -- `ragdollMode` never writes `dead` at all (one writer in the whole
  class, and `dead := false` **exists nowhere**: the game has no revive). Worse, the "conversion"
  call was a no-op on an already-ragdolled player, and on the path where it *did* execute,
  `fallen(false)` reaches `@39685`, re-reads `dead`, finds it set, and **jumps back into the death
  chain** -- the undo re-arms the thing it is undoing. *Look FIRST:* before designing any
  detect-and-revert, disassemble the transition and ask **"is this a flag or an armed chain?"** If
  a `Delay` / `RetriggerableDelay` / timer / montage appears anywhere in it, undo is off the table
  **while the chain is in flight** -- but see the correction below before concluding what to do
  instead. Corollary that cost the same bug twice over: the lane's other layer was a ProcessEvent interceptor on
  `Add Player Damage`, and all seven of its ubergraph call sites are `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` --
  **INVISIBLE** -- so both layers were dead and the feature could not have worked on any build,
  which nothing caught because no test had ever killed a player. Full chain:
  `research/findings/world-systems/votv-player-death-chain-RE-2026-08-31.md`.
  [[lesson-a-latent-chain-cannot-be-undone-by-clearing-its-flag]]

- **A chain does not end where it leaves the class you are reading -- and a latent chain's END is
  where undo becomes LEGAL.** `[V]` 2026-08-31, the same death chain, hours later. The map stopped at
  `@4277 lib_C::loadLevel('menu')` because that is where the flow exits `mainPlayer_C`, and from that
  stopping point the conclusion looked forced: every hop is `EX_Local*`, nothing is hookable,
  therefore the only shape is to PREVENT the death. **Both halves were wrong.** Following it three
  assets further -- `lib.loadLevel` -> `mainGamemode::transition` -> uber `@92640` -> **`@7160
  OpenLevel(...)`** -- lands on a NATIVE call, the one hop an ordinary `UFunction::Func` patch takes,
  so no VM-interception substrate and no bytecode patch were ever needed. And the second half is the
  one that inverts the design: **by the time the last hop runs, both `RetriggerableDelay`s have fired
  and been consumed**, so the latent state that made an undo impossible mid-chain is spent -- a revive
  is legal at the END and illegal five seconds earlier. *Look FIRST:* when a chain leaves the asset
  you are disassembling, that is the middle of the map, not the end of it -- keep going until you
  reach a NATIVE frame or a true terminal, and only then choose the cut. "No seam exists" is a claim
  about how far you read. Costs of stopping early here: a whole design shipped on a suppressive gate
  (crutch C3), three HIGH defects, and a CI gate turned red.

- **A wrong-offset reflected write NEVER faults where you wrote it.** `SetSizeBoxWidth` was called on what `AddFramedBox` returns — an **Overlay**, not a SizeBox, as that helper's own header says one line above the call. The float landed at a foreign property offset, nothing faulted there, and the game died three frames later in another subsystem: `PE detour-outer-callback AV caught function='SpawnObject' 0xC0000005` three times, with the first readable symptom being an action bar whose three buttons were all null. Reflection-driven writes have no call-site type check by construction — the offset comes from a NAME on a class you never asserted. **Look here FIRST:** a crash inside an engine function your change never touched, in a session that added a reflected `Set*`, IS that write until proven otherwise — list every one you added and check its RECEIVER type against what the producing helper actually returns, before reading the faulting function at all. [[lesson-a-wrong-offset-write-never-faults-where-you-wrote-it]]

- **A UMG getter may read back YOUR OWN REQUEST, not the engine's state.** `[V]` 2026-08-26, twice:
  `UScrollBox::GetScrollOffset` returns Slate's `DesiredScrollOffset` — the value last *asked for*,
  unclamped. `SetScrollOffset(1000000)` then `GetScrollOffset()` returns **1000000.0**, on an EMPTY
  box AND on one holding 30 rows with 1391 units of real overflow. So a Set/Get round-trip through it
  is a tautology that **cannot fail**, and a positive control built on it passes on a widget that does
  not scroll at all. Read `GetViewOffsetFraction` (the scrollbar's distance-from-top — physical
  post-layout state) for "did it move", and `GetScrollOffsetOfEnd` (content minus viewport — real
  geometry, and its arithmetic closes independently) for "is there anywhere to go". Same API, second
  trap: an **empty** `UScrollBox` reports `GetScrollOffsetOfEnd() = 1.0`, so a precondition written
  `offsetOfEnd > 0` — which reads like "there is content" — opens on a box holding nothing. *Look
  FIRST:* before reading a getter to confirm a write landed, ask whether it reads back your own
  request; prefer the getter that names a RENDERED quantity over the one that mirrors the setter's
  noun; never threshold a layout float at `> 0`. Wrappers: `ue_wrap/engine/umg_build.{h,cpp}`.

- **A hand-built widget tree that is not ATTACHED is unreferenced, and GC takes it.** `[V]`
  2026-08-30, hands-on: both native screens built a full `UUserWidget` subtree in `BuildScreen`
  and attached it lazily in `Show()`, so between building the menu screen and the player's click
  nothing referenced it. The user's log: `AddChild slot=0000000000000000, GetChildIndex=-1` with
  **41 GC lines in the same window**. It had two faces and the first hid the second -- while the
  index was `ChildCount - 1`, a failed add named the last of the GAME's screens and MULTIPLAYER
  opened VOTV's Stats panel; once the index was PROVEN the same failure gave an honest -1 and the
  button went dead. **No automated run could ever see it**: `browser_autoopen=1` calls `Show()` on
  the SAME TICK as the build, so the lab took a route with no gap for GC. *Look FIRST:* attach in
  the function that BUILDS (a switcher child is reachable from the menu -- that is the reference
  you want; `AddToRoot` is the wrong tool, and RUNG 2's "survives a forced GC" was measured on an
  ATTACHED subtree, which is exactly the window it does not cover); never discard `AddChild`'s
  returned `UPanelSlot*`; and when a bug reproduces for a human and never in the lab on the SAME
  code path, diff what the harness does to the CLOCK, not the code.

- **A surface can be half-dead in a way that is invisible BECAUSE its other half is correct.** `[V]`
  2026-08-30: **no runtime text colour on the native server browser had ever applied.** Glyph-body
  histogram off the self-check's own capture — hovered row frame `#FFFF00` x77 px but its text
  `#FFFFFF` x216; World/Age cells specified `#A5A5A5` reading `#FFFFFF`. So hover yellow, the dim
  columns, the green "your server" and the **amber version-mismatch cue** (the signal that the join
  gate will refuse that server — a correctness defect, not a cosmetic one) were all dead for four
  days. Cause: `ApplyRowTextColors` called the RAW `engine::SetTextBlockColor`, whose own
  declaration says IN CAPITALS it "never propagates" to a block in a **constructed UMG/Slate tree**
  (UMG bakes properties into the Slate widget at attach); `SetTextBlockColorDispatch` is the setter
  variant, and `ui/multiplayer_menu.cpp:155` already used it for this exact reason. **Why nobody
  saw it: the column headers are `#FF7C00` and always were — they are coloured at BUILD time,
  before attach, where a raw write DOES land.** It also survived a green self-check, because
  `ROW SELECT PASS` / `HoveredRow()` assert STATE, never pixels. *Look FIRST:* when a UI property
  "does not take", check raw-write vs setter-dispatch before anything else (the same split governs
  `SetImageTint`/`...Raw` and `SetSizeBoxHeight`'s `bOverride_*` bitfield); and treat
  **build-time-correct + runtime-dead** as a shape — if a screen has both paths, the runtime one is
  the one with no witness. `coop/dev/native_ui_probe.cpp:642` has the same raw call and is
  UNVERIFIED. `memory/lesson-a-surface-can-be-half-dead-because-its-other-half-is-correct.md`
- **In UI code a wrong constant does not error — it renders wrong, often invisibly.** `[V]`
  2026-08-26, two in one restyle. `ESlateVisibility` is
  `Visible=0 Collapsed=1 HIDDEN=2 HitTestInvisible=3 SelfHitTestInvisible=4`; writing `2` meaning
  "chrome, draws but is not a hit target" gets **Hidden**, and a whole window frame, panel fill, title
  strip and footer strip silently did not draw — the capture's apparent "window" was the rows' own
  backgrounds stacked with the title floating outside them, which reads as a LAYOUT bug and got
  debugged as one. (`multiplayer_menu.cpp` already carried the correct mapping in a comment.) And
  `FLinearColor` is **LINEAR** while colours sampled from a screenshot are **sRGB**: writing
  `0x31/255 = 0.192` as a tint puts sRGB `#7B` on screen, more than double, so the whole palette
  renders washed out and re-picking values cannot fix it because the error is in the units. Related:
  a palette read by EYE off a downscaled render invents colours the game does not use — two of mine
  did (a header read as green sampled `#FFFFFF`, 650 px with no green in its top three; a size read
  as cyan sampled `#A5A5A5`). *Look FIRST:* grep for an existing comment/wrapper naming an enum before
  writing it as a bare int; convert sRGB → linear (`Srgb()` in `server_browser_native.cpp`) rather
  than dividing by 255; sample full-size PNGs with a histogram; and when a UI change looks
  mis-LAID-OUT, first check everything you expected to DRAW actually drew.

- **Slate's hit-test answers the PREVIOUS pointer position** — `IsHovered()` sampled in the SAME
  game-thread tick that moved the cursor read the old position EVERY time, and inverted both
  readings (hover-ON 0 while the next five samples read 1; hover-OFF 1 while the next five read 0).
  Move and sample must be separate ticks. Same run: a bare `UImage` with `Visibility=Visible` DOES
  answer `IsHovered()` and DISCRIMINATES — but only when the target is BOUNDED; a full-bleed widget
  answers `1` always and proves nothing.
  `memory/lesson_slate_hit_test_answers_the_previous_pointer_position.md`
- **A UMG slot bounds the LAYOUT, not the painting** — a weighted `UHorizontalBoxSlot` lets a long
  value paint straight over the next column until `SetClipping(ClipToBounds)` plus a gutter. Two
  more from the same build: a `UImage` with a tint and NO `ResourceObject` draws a SOLID RECT (the
  game's own sub-screen backdrop is exactly that — a full-screen 50%-black scrim, `Image_302`, so a
  scrim needs no donor), and `USizeBox::HeightOverride` is INERT unless driven through the UFunction
  because its `bOverride_*` bit is a separate bitfield at +0x150.

- **`FindObjectByClass` answers "the FIRST instance", which is not "the LIVE one" — and a
  WidgetBlueprint has a second non-CDO instance to trip on.** 2026-08-25: reading VOTV's style donors
  through `R::FindObjectByClass(L"ui_saveSlots_C")` reported **every** widget field on
  `ui_saveSlots_C` and `ui_settings_C` null, while both classes had a fully-populated instance sitting
  in `ui_menu_C::switcher_widgets` as children 4 and 1. `[V]` A `WidgetBlueprint` carries a widget-tree
  TEMPLATE that is a real instance of the generated class and is **not** named `Default__<Class>`, so
  the CDO skip at `reflection.cpp:511` does not exclude it. The null read is not a crash — it is a
  *plausible finding* ("nested sub-screen widgets don't exist until the screen is shown") that fits the
  data, has a believable UMG mechanism, and would have forced a donor-table redesign around a
  precondition the design had already rejected. A whole probe rung was written to measure the cause of
  a phenomenon that did not exist. *Look FIRST:* prefer the owner that structurally HOLDS the object
  (`GetChildAt(i)`, a panel's `Slots`, a field on the live parent); when a class-wide lookup is
  unavoidable, print the pointer you used AND the one the lookup returns — they differ silently, and
  "the field is null" vs "I read a different instance" look identical in a log. A uniformly-null read
  across many fields of one object is a smell about the OBJECT, not the fields.

- **A cache reads null when the thing it caches is absent — so that null is not evidence about the
  cache.** 2026-08-25, asking whether `FSlateBrush`'s unreflected `FSlateResourceHandle` at **+0x70**
  (0x88 struct; reflected fields end at `ImageType` @0x6F, bitfields resume @0x80) is populated, which
  gates whether `InjectCanvasButton`'s 0x278 `FButtonStyle` memcpy aliases a refcounted pointer with no
  `AddRef`. The probe read the obvious donor — `ui_menu_C.button_start`, the button the shipped inject
  actually clones — found 0/4 handles set and printed *"there is NO handle bug"*. `[V]` All four of that
  donor's brushes carry **no `ResourceObject` at all**: VOTV's own main-menu buttons have no brush art,
  which is separately worth knowing (it is why the inject looks native without loading a texture). The
  caveat was already written in a comment three lines above the verdict that contradicted it. Re-read
  against `ui_saveSlots_C.button_back` (which does carry `inst_uiButton`): **0/4 handles across 3/4
  brushes that DO carry a resource** — and only that licensed the conclusion. *Look FIRST:* when a
  probe answers "the derived thing is absent", ask what it derives FROM **on this exact sample**; null
  cache + null source is a THIRD verdict (`INCONCLUSIVE`) that must exist in the code, not only in a
  comment. Pick the sample that can produce a positive.

- **VOTV's own maximum player speed is NOCLIP, not sprint — and noclip is reachable in ordinary play.**
  Measured 2026-08-25 from the BP dumps while sizing a movement bound: walk is `defSpeed = 400`; sprint
  is `defSpeed * 2.0 * Lerp(1.0, 1.25, agility/100)`, so **<= 1000 cm/s**; the ATV's `speed_turbo` is
  3200; and **no `TerminalVelocity` override exists in any of the 292 asset dumps**, so UE4's ~4000
  default stands. Noclip (`mainPlayer` ubergraph @64501) is `SelectFloat(5000, SelectFloat(250, 1000,
  crouch), run)` applied as **three separately summed `dir * dt * 5000` terms** (@64694..@64974), so its
  worst case is `sqrt(3) * 5000 = 8660 cm/s` — 8.7x sprint. It is gated by `lib_C::isBuoyant`, whose
  name is about buoyancy and whose body is not; the branch that matters returns `gamemode.hasWeapon`,
  a story flag, so **a bound written against "the fastest the game can move a player" must cover 8660,
  not 1000**. Also measured in the same pass, and worth having: `mainPlayer.armLength = 200.0` is the
  default interaction reach, `arm()` is called at exactly **10 sites game-wide** (1000 for the coin gun
  and groundHose, 300 for prop_vacuum2, 0 -> 200 everywhere else), and **`arm()` starts at the
  CAMERA** (`GetPlayerCameraManager().K2_GetActorLocation()`), not the actor root — three shipped
  comments carried a `[V]` tag on "FROM THE PLAYER" until `abc9681b`.

- **2026-08-25 — A default-on-failure return is FAIL-OPEN whenever the default is a LEGAL value.**
  `E::GetActorLocation` returns a default `FVector` on every failure path and cannot signal it -- and
  `(0,0,0)` is the WORLD ORIGIN, an ordinary reachable position. Inside the coin gun's reach gate (a
  function whose own comment said FAIL-CLOSED) a failed read therefore authorized anything near the
  origin and falsely refused everything else. Same shape one level up: `E::GetActorBounds` returns
  `true` for *the dispatch succeeded*, not *the box is meaningful* -- an actor with no colliding
  components yields `Origin=(0,0,0) Extent=(0,0,0)` with a `true` return. Fixed at the WRAPPER
  (`E::TryGetActorLocation`), not the call site. *Look FIRST:* in any authorization gate, open every
  accessor it reads and ask what it returns on failure; grep `ue_wrap/engine` for `Type Get...()`
  returning by value. `memory/lesson_a_default_return_is_fail_open_when_the_default_is_legal.md`
- **2026-08-23 — An instance index without BOTH a CDO filter and a world filter silently indexes
  the CLASS DEFAULT OBJECT.** turbine_sync (the one scan consumer with no `Default__` skip) had a
  phantom 5th "placed turbine" — the CDO — for its whole life: IsInstance matches the CDO
  (class-pure), IsLive passes (CDOs are live), PosKey quantized its DEFAULT position into a stable
  key IDENTICAL on both peers, so every count/parity/N-match instrument agreed 5==5 and the poll
  "synced" it CDO-to-CDO. Only an ORTHOGONAL discriminator — the R-2 hub's per-MATCH
  `WorldOf(obj)==CurrentWorld()` term (a CDO outers to its package, not a world) — broke the
  symmetry (probe=5 hub=4). The name skip and the world test exclude DIFFERENT non-instances;
  carry both. *Look FIRST:* the WorldOf term (`object_scan_hub.cpp` audit-W-3 comment) + the
  turbine probe-row comment (`autotest_scanparity.cpp`).

- **2026-08-22 — WILDCARDING an AOB can DESTROY its uniqueness: measure occurrences AFTER masking,
  never before.** Deriving `kSigD3D11ViewportPresentChecked`: the LITERAL first 24 bytes of
  `sub_1416F4BA0` occurred exactly ONCE in the image — but the same window with the `/GS`
  `mov rax,[rip+disp32]` displacement wildcarded (mandatory: that disp moves on EVERY rebuild)
  matched **TWO** places, and stayed ambiguous at 32 bytes; it becomes unique only at 40 (shipped at
  48 for margin). Masking removes information, and the bytes that individuate a short MSVC prologue
  are frequently the very displacement you are about to wildcard — so "found a unique prologue, now
  let me wildcard the volatile parts" is the WRONG order and fails SILENTLY (FindPattern just returns
  whichever site comes first -> a hook on the wrong function, which will not look like a signature
  bug at runtime). **Look FIRST: `tools/debug/ida_aob_derive.py sig 0x<ea>` — it prints occurrences
  per window length with the mask ALREADY applied, names the first-unique length and emits a
  margin'd signature; grow into register-move/struct-offset bytes, which survive rebuilds.**

- **2026-08-22 — UE ships its own `__FILE__` paths into the SHIPPING exe, so an engine source-file
  name is the fastest anchor into that subsystem's functions.** The VOTV shipping exe contains
  `D:/Build/++UE4/Sync/Engine/Source/Runtime/Windows/D3D11RHI/Private/WindowsD3D11Viewport.cpp` (and
  the D3D12/Vulkan twins) as UTF-16 literals, because UE's `VERIFYD3D11RESULT`-style macros pass
  `__FILE__` — plus the failing EXPRESSION as a literal (`"SwapChain->GetFullscreenState(...)"`), which
  names the function for you. Xref'ing one string produced the entire D3D11 viewport present cluster
  in a single pass; symbols are stripped (`sub_XXXXXXXX`) but string literals are not debug info and
  survive. **Decoy warning:** searching the DXGI HRESULTs (`0x887A0005/6/7`) finds the error-FORMATTING
  helpers (`VerifyD3D11Result` family, `GetD3D11ErrorString`), one layer away from the present path —
  good for confirming the neighborhood, useless for locating the seam. **Look FIRST:

- **2026-08-21 — "one binary across plugin-host versions" is decided by the VTABLE HISTORY, not the
  API docs.** Measured on UE4SS v3.0.1 vs main-2026-05: `on_ui_init` INSERTED mid-vtable (+5
  appended, one signature change) = full-API one-binary mis-dispatches by construction, while the C
  loading contract (`GetProcAddress("start_mod")`, `Mods/<n>/dlls/main.dll`, `enabled.txt`) stayed
  byte-stable 27 months. Safe cross-version shape = the C contract + a no-op stub vtable + an
  object coupling censused EMPTY (all fire_* void, never deleted, no field reads); the one hole =
  a future sret virtual (watch it, don't assume it). LOOK FIRST: diff the base-class virtual
  declaration ORDER across the versions users actually hold; census what the host DOES with your
  object. `memory/lesson_one_binary_across_plugin_hosts_is_decided_by_vtable_history.md`
- **2026-08-21 — an ecosystem "standard" names a LANE; check which, and what is actually
  installed.** "UE4SS is the modloader everything uses" was true for LUA and near-empty for C++
  (~8 public repos, two query shapes); "the stable everyone has" was FALSE for VOTV — the
  community pipeline AND its manual guides ship the shimloader bundle (UE4SS.dll PE 2026-02-03,
  experimental-era), not the 1.99M-download v3.0.1. Flipped the pin, the spike order, and the Lua
  plan in one day. LOOK FIRST: the community package index + PE-timestamp the bundled artifact +
  read the community's own install guides; never infer the install base from upstream download
  counts. `memory/lesson_an_ecosystem_standard_names_a_lane_check_which.md`

- **An accessor on a WRAPPER answers about the wrapper, not the thing you meant.** MEASURED
  2026-07-31: `UWidget::HasKeyboardFocus()` on a live, on-screen `UEditableTextBox` reads **false**
  even immediately after calling the engine's own `SetKeyboardFocus()` on that very widget —
  `target{kb=0 desc=0 anyUser=0} iface{kb=1 desc=0 anyUser=1}`. UMG never hands Slate your
  `UEditableTextBox`; it wraps it in an `SObjectWidget` around the real `SEditableTextBox`, and the
  accessor tests the cached WRAPPER exactly. The owning `UUserWidget` reports focus correctly. An
  entire arc (the "is a game text field focused" predicate for GitHub issue #5) had been designed on
  the per-field version across 10 `/qf` rounds; the shipped invariant became "a game `UUserWidget`
  holds keyboard focus". **Look FIRST: round-trip any reflected accessor before designing on it —
  set the state through the engine's own API and read it straight back. When the engine WRAPS the
  object you hold (UMG `UWidget`->Slate `SWidget`, component->scene proxy, actor->physics body),
  assume the accessor answers about the wrapper until measured. And a predicate that can only ever
  be wrong in the `false` direction needs a positive control on purpose** — a healthy build and a
  dead predicate otherwise produce identical logs.
  Full: `[[lesson-an-accessor-on-a-wrapper-answers-about-the-wrapper]]`; commit `f03c04f0`.

- **`R::FindFunction` does NOT walk the superclass chain** — it matches `OuterOf(fn) == owningClass`
  EXACTLY (`ue_wrap/core/reflection.cpp:427`; no chain-walking variant exists anywhere in
  `reflection.h`). So `FindFunction(ClassOf(instance), "SomeInheritedFn")` returns **nullptr** whenever
  the function is declared on a BASE class — the normal case for any BP subclass — and callers that skip
  a null do nothing, silently, forever. CONFIRMED CASUALTY (measured 2026-07-22): the container lane's
  `updateVolumesAndMass` re-derive resolved from `ClassOf(owner)` = `Aprop_inventoryContainer_drone_C`
  while the function is declared only on `Aprop_container_C` (SDK `prop_container.hpp:32`) → the
  re-derive had **never once run** on any peer, which is the `686`-vs-`0.0` currVol the user
  photographed. The buggy code carried a CONFIDENT comment reasoning about override-vs-layout hazards —
  sound about the wrong hazard, and it hid this one. Blast radius is NOT all 414 call sites: the
  dominant idiom (`FindClass("SceneComponent") -> K2_GetComponentLocation`) is correct by construction;
  the risk class is the **19 sites passing `ClassOf(instance)`** plus sites naming a BP class for an
  inherited function (`door_probe.cpp:81` `SetActorTickEnabled` = a second near-certain inert case).
  **AUDITED 2026-07-22 -- the risk class was swept and is CLEAN, but the PREDICATE was wrong.** All 19
  `ClassOf(instance)` sites are SAFE (library CDOs calling their own function, or instances whose exact
  class declares the verb). The one dead resolve in the batch — `coop/dev/door_probe.cpp:81`
  `SetActorTickEnabled` on `door_C`, declared on `AActor` — passes `FindClass(L"door_C")`, **not**
  `ClassOf(instance)`, so the `ClassOf(` filter would have missed the only corpse. The real predicate is
  **"a LEAF class resolving a BASE-declared function, however that class was obtained"**. It is never
  invoked, so nothing breaks; the damage is an instrument printing `setTick=0000000000000000`
  unremarked. Eight cached-BP-class shipping sites re-checked on the corrected predicate: all SAFE.
  Latent, and NOT one item — split by consequence, not mechanism: **`spawn_menu.cpp:130`/`:165` are
  LOAD-BEARING** (they gate the input-mode restore the file itself calls "THE LOAD-BEARING UN-STICK";
  a wordless death after a recook traps the player's input in `GameAndUI`), while
  `save_browser.cpp:188` is a deliberate fail-open whose worst case is a mis-listed save name.
  **The audit closed the RESOLVE axis only — that a call LANDS (ParamFrame, param names,
  `EX_*`-invisible dispatch) was never checked.** **Look here FIRST:** the ownership authority is
  `Game_0.9.0n_HOST/.../Win64/CXXHeaderDump/*.hpp` (2645 files, each block = only that class's OWN
  functions). Check which class DECLARES the function before writing any `FindFunction`, filter on
  leaf-vs-base rather than on the call shape, and always LOG a failed resolve.

- **Container CONTENTS live in ONE global `saveSlot_C::GObjStack`, never on the container** — every
  container in the game (world props, backpacks, the drone delivery container, AND `mainPlayer`'s personal
  inventory) reads its contents from that single `TArray<struct_mObject>`, addressed by
  `propInventory_C.index` (an `Array_Add` append position, guarded by `index >= 0`, persisted via the
  owner's `struct_save.ints[]`). `struct_mObject = {obj: TArray<struct_save>}`; each entry is a FULL
  generic save-record (`class`/`transform`/`key` + 10 uniform jagged primitive arrays + `signals[]`), so a
  wire codec is ONE generic serializer + the existing `coop::signal_wire` — no per-class codec. Three traps:
  (1) **asymmetric authority** — the player's personal inventory shares the array, discriminator is
  `propInventory_C.player`; a blind host-authored write wipes client inventories; (2) **dispatch** — every
  mutating verb (`addObject`/`takeObj`/`addLoot`) is `EX_LocalVirtualFunction`, invisible to BOTH the
  ProcessEvent detour and the Func patch → `vm_dispatch` 0x45 is the only seam; (3) **nesting by
  indirection** — a nested container's record carries a `GObjStack` INDEX, so a flat copy ships a pointer
  into the sender's array (silent corruption, not an honest empty); detect via
  `WalksToBase(cls, prop_container_C)` `[RD]`. *Look FIRST:*

- **A container take RE-CREATES the record — identity does NOT survive the transfer** (2026-07-24,
  33-statement decode + 2-run live confirm). `Aprop_container_C::extract`: `takeObj` yields the source
  record → `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` takes **only its CLASS** (the deferred window applies NO
  properties — it is all pawn-transform math) → `FinishSpawningActor` → `putObjectInventory2` →
  `addObject` → **`getData` CAPTURES the freshly-spawned carrier** → `K2_DestroyActor` → and only THEN
  `loadData(takeObj_Output)`. **Mint at spawn, captured at add.** Live: across two runs of one save the
  four save-loaded items kept byte-identical keys while the one taken item got a new key each run
  (matching the destroy-seam line for the carrier). **DIRECTION-SPECIFIC** — the player-container
  override is the same function minus exactly two statements (`putObjectInventory2` +
  `K2_DestroyActor`), so its `loadData` DOES restore a live actor; never state this about `extract` in
  general. *Consequence:* any custody/anti-dup design must contend over the **SOURCE record's key**,
  which exists in the container's `GObjStack` slot before any spawn — the destination key is downstream
  of the contention. *Does NOT mean the item lands empty* (predicted, then FALSIFIED: `{b5,f3,nm2}`);
  whether the saved VALUES survive is still OPEN. *Look FIRST:*

- **A PLACED actor's cross-peer identity = its BAKED level-export FName, NOT a gamemode-assigned save
  Key.** VOTV keys `AtriggerBase_C` descendants (doors/garage) via a ONE-SHOT, sublevel-gated gamemode
  pass (`mainGamemode::loadObjects` → `GetAllActorsWithInterface` + `loadTriggers`, gated by
  `isSublevelAllowed` — kismet-analyzer bytecode); an actor mid-recycle at that instant stays `Key=None`
  and is dropped by any None-key filter FOREVER. The export FName is serialized in the cooked package →
  identical on both peers by construction + present regardless of keying. take-4 R9: host garage index
  1→0 (unkeyed) through a menu→save reload while 50 same-keyed doors survived; `door_box` FName identity
  (same `untitled_1` package) came through the SAME reload byte-identical cross-peer. Fix (v123): mirror
  `door_box::GetNameKey`, delete the Key path (RULE 2). Look FIRST: `ue_wrap::garage::GetNameKey` vs
  `ue_wrap::door_box::GetNameKey`; do NOT broadly migrate working Key channels (principle 4).

- **A SAVE-LOADED prop's runtime FName is NOT cross-peer stable — key it by its persistent SAVE KEY.**
  The baked-FName rule above covers LEVEL sublevel exports (`door_box`, serialized into the cooked
  `.umap`, identical on every peer). A **save-loaded** prop (a container, an item — spawned at world-load
  by `loadObjects`, NOT baked into the level) gets its FName *Number* from **spawn ORDER at load**, which
  differs between the host's load and a joining client's save-transfer load: measured 2026-07-23, the same
  file cabinet was `prop_container_..._2147472736` (host) vs `..._2147471758` (client). Selecting a
  shared/synced target by FName thus picks DIFFERENT actors per peer. The stable-by-construction key is the
  prop's **persistent SAVE KEY** (the FName the game writes into the save), via
  `coop::prop_element_tracker::CollectKeyIndexEntries → {actor, key}`; post-s22 its keyed eid is
  host-authoritative. This **overturned /qf R11-Q3** ("shared target by baked FName" — its premise was
  false for containers). The fallback of keying by WORLD POSITION is the `RULE-1 hope` /qf R2-Q2 rejected
  (a property of the current save's geometry, not an invariant); nav-reachability is a test-feasibility
  filter, not the identity. Validated: two peers picked the SAME container by save-key + the cross-peer
  count summed to 1. *Look FIRST:* level-baked (baked FName ok) vs save-loaded (use the save KEY) before
  keying any cross-peer decision on a prop. `memory/lesson_save_loaded_prop_fname_unstable_use_save_key.md`

  mirror actor) all slipped it. Re-run the grep for real (`\bIsLive\s*\(` minus fresh/same-frame + autotest,
  keep cached-ptr + UFunction-CALL + teardown-reachable); all fixed 07-15. **PROVEN AGAIN 2026-08-22: a

  list + the CachedObjRef fix design =
  `research/findings/tooling/votv-islive-zeroav-cachedobjref-DESIGN-2026-08-22.md` Appendix A). Two
  sharpenings from that pass: `IsLiveByIndex` never reads FUObjectItem **SerialNumber**, so a
  same-address SAME-SLOT successor passes (ABA — filed residual); and UE assigns serials LAZILY (0 until
  a weak ref exists), so naive serial capture does not close it either. **CONVERTED WHOLE 2026-08-22

- **2026-08-22 — a dying world's actors are NOT kill-flagged even after the MENU world is up** (measured:
  `trash_pile` re-indexed 311 of the dying gameplay world's piles AT the menu, 16:46:03 — every one
  passed IsLive's kill-flag check), so ANY liveness-based gate lags GC purge by seconds. Two dependent
  traps: the `worldUp = Registry::Local() != nullptr` gate keeps the session chain running against the
  dying world for the flee poll's ≤4 s window, and a session-install fanout re-running in that window
  indexes soon-to-dangle actors. World-state gates must key on WORLD IDENTITY / travel-start signals,
  never on per-object liveness. NOTE: `engine.cpp` `g_worldContext` is the GAMEINSTANCE (immortal) — not
  a current-world read. **WIRE LEG MEASURED 2026-08-22 (`mp.py wirewindow`, permanent instrument): the
  exit window leaks NOTHING** — an EXISTING gameplay→MENU session-stop edge (`net_pump`) closes the
  session at ~+1 s (not the 4 s flee poll); only ~2 s of pose stream crosses; zero reliables; the
  destroy-seam episode gates held under world-teardown mass K2_DestroyActor → D2 stays deferred, its
  residual harm = wasted local work. LOOK FIRST: the D2 section of
  `research/findings/tooling/votv-islive-zeroav-cachedobjref-DESIGN-2026-08-22.md` (probe RESULT +
  seam candidates), and `coop/dev/wire_census` for re-measuring. **SOLO asymmetry (2026-08-23): the
  ~+1 s session-stop edge and the ≤4 s flee poll exist only WITH a session — a SOLO quit-to-menu has
  neither, and the dead pawn stayed slot-live 44+ s (until the next world load's purge), vs ~3 s on
  the same log's connected quit. The stale window is transition-path-dependent.**
  **PAWN != WORLD (2026-08-25, B4): this 44 s was measured on a PAWN and does NOT transfer to the WORLD
  object without measuring it.** The v137 doc's D3 row used the figure to explain why a cached
  `FindObjectByClass(WorldClass)` never invalidated -- a silent pawn->world transfer that stood for a
  day. Measured on the world directly (`VOTVCOOP_WORLD_ID_PROBE=1`): `liveWorlds` 1->2->1 in about
  **5 s** here. Both can be true; they are different objects. Cite which one you measured.
- **2026-08-23 — `access=FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` in a PE-absorb line = NON-CANONICAL pointer deref**
  (#GP-class AV, `ExceptionInformation[1] = -1`, the Windows "address unknown" convention) — the code
  dereferenced scribbled garbage, not a mapped-but-wrong address. Reading pattern: constant ip +
  constant access + VARYING self across thousands of lines ⇒ the poison is a SHARED INPUT to the call
  (an argument/global — in the triage, the stale PlayerController), never per-object corruption.

  set `HAlign_Fill(0)`+zero padding after SetContent (UMG.hpp:314-318; `Fill=0/Left=1/Center=2`). (3) An
  external-poll click on a real UButton must fire on the RELEASE edge (down-edge → overlay swallows the
  UP → button stuck DOWN). (4) Keep FSlateSound `ResourceObject`(0x00), zero ONLY the trailing TSharedPtr
  cache(0x08) → native `buttonclick`/`buttonrollover` play without aliasing. (5) Play VOTV sounds via
  `PlaySoundAtLocation` (null att = 2D) so the game's SoundClass/mix apply; the menu's press bg-dim is the
  submenu/loadLevel fade, NOT a per-button style (replicate with a modal ImGui backdrop).

- **UMG runtime injection = 3 traps (native version label, 2026-07-16)** — (1) raw property writes work
  ONLY pre-Slate-attach; after `AddChildTo*`, UMG has baked props into Slate, so changes MUST be setter
  UFunction dispatches (`SetColorAndOpacity` etc. — a raw write silently doesn't repaint; the "no cyan"
  bug). (2) The insert-at-top reorder (snapshot→ClearChildren→re-add) DESTROYS every slot and creates
  DEFAULTS — save each child's slot layout region before Clear + restore onto the RE-READ new slot; never
  reuse a pre-reorder slot pointer (`InsertAtTopOfVBox`, engine_widget.cpp). (3) Never assume the parent
  panel type — resolve the target's slot chain in `research/bp_reflection/<widget>_fixed.json` first
  (txt_version = a HorizontalBox row in VerticalBox_138, NOT a canvas child; the canvas-API attempt
  rendered inline-RIGHT). Look here FIRST: reuse `InjectTextRowAbove`/`SetTextBlockColorDispatch`.

- **The literal string "None" trips WriteFNameField's failed-intern check** (StringToFName("None") ==
  {0,0} == NAME_None, indistinguishable from a failed intern; ReadStruct renders NAME_None back AS
  "None" -> string round-trips asymmetrically fail). Express NAME_None with the EMPTY string. Cost a

- **SCALING A MULTIPLIER IS NOT SCALING A SIZE — and truncating one below 1 DELETES it.** Measured
  2026-07-31, and it is the whole root of the "no cursor showing" bug the user reported 07-27:
  `ImGuiStyle::ScaleAllSizes` ends with `MouseCursorScale = ImTrunc(MouseCursorScale * f)`
  (`imgui.cpp:1649`). Every OTHER field it touches is a **pixel size**, where round-toward-zero is
  sensible; `MouseCursorScale` is a unitless **multiplier** consumed as `pos + size * scale`
  (`imgui.cpp:4131`). Our `ui::scale::Ui()` measured **0.833**, so `ImTrunc(0.833) == 0` and the
  cursor became a **zero-area quad** — with the OS cursor hidden by our own `WM_SETCURSOR` handler,
  that is NO cursor. Present since **v1.91.5**, not a 1.92 regression. It reads as *intermittent*
  only because the factor tracks client size (harmless at >= 1.0). Every health signal stayed GREEN
  throughout (`MouseDrawCursor=1 texOk=1 atlasFlags=0`) because nothing is broken — the geometry is
  multiplied by zero. *Look FIRST:* the LAST lines of any bulk "scale everything" helper, where the
  fields that do not fit its unit assumption cluster; and when something is "sometimes" broken,
  find the axis it varies along and PRINT it beside the symptom (`curScale=0.000 uiScale=0.833`
  ended this in one line). `memory/lesson_scaling_a_multiplier_is_not_scaling_a_size.md`
- **MSVC vtable slots follow OVERLOAD GROUPING, not declaration order.** 2026-08-21, the D-3 spike's
  per-slot dispatch counters: `CppUserModBase::on_dll_load` fired at slot 13 where declaration order
  predicts 9, and the first suspicion (upstream ABI drift) was FALSE — today's header re-diffed
  line-identical to 2026-05. The rule: MSVC clusters ALL overloads of one virtual name at the FIRST
  declaration's position, in REVERSE declaration order (the 4 `on_lua_start` + 4 `on_lua_stop`
  overloads occupy slots 5-12, pushing everything after). Both live eras' censuses fit exactly.
  *Look FIRST:* before numbering any MSVC vtable, group overloads at first-declaration-reversed; a
  census that misses decl order is not necessarily drift. Worked mapping: the F2 design doc §3 AS-RUN.

  2026-08-21, spike drill a2v2: `unreal_shimloader` Rust-panics BY DESIGN on ANY `xinput1_3.dll`
  beside the exe (its anti-2023-UE4SS guard; hits our proxy by filename alone), writes
  `shimloader-log.txt` naming the file with removal steps, and the game idles windowless — NOTHING
  loads, not even our proxy's payload. Our `REFUSE reason=predecessor-*` dialog (live-drilled and
  working on plain-UE4SS installs, cells b2/a3) is structurally unreachable there. *Look FIRST:*
  "game won't start" from an r2modman user → read `Win64/shimloader-log.txt`; INSTALL.md's r2modman
  upgrade language = delete the old standalone install FIRST; and check shimloader's guard strings
  before ever shipping a new file beside the exe.

- **2026-08-22 -- VOTV crash dumps live in %LOCALAPPDATA%\VotV\Saved\Crashes, and PCallStackHash
  groups identical crashes across runs; a green drill can hide a crashed boot.** The WP-2 UE4SS-lane
  boot flake was attributed by hash identity (3 crashes, one SILENT during the 08-21 spike evening)
  plus a byte-exact match of the dump's faulting IP against our own logged `trampoline <base>` line
  (fault = ProcessEvent trampoline +0x14). **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-08-26, and the technique settled a
  DIFFERENT defect: the faulting ADDRESS (not the IP) matched the trampoline base exactly --
  `AV reading 0x00007ff6e7cf0fc0` against a drill line reading `trampoline 00007FF6E7CF0FC0` -- which
  is a use-after-free of the slot, not a corrupted relay. Two crash families, one address-matching
  method; see `docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` section 4c and
  [[lesson-the-trampoline-is-not-the-original-function]].** The install-dir `VotV/Saved/` does NOT exist -- mp.py's
  `_game_log()` fatal-scan reads a path that never has data (open defect). LOOK FIRST: list the
  Crashes dir by mtime and compare PCallStackHash BEFORE theorizing; decode with python
  minidump+capstone (recipe in the lesson). **UPDATE 2026-08-22 pm:** the default dump is a TRIAGE
  dump (no code/trampoline pages) — pass `-fullcrashdump` (mp.py `MP_FULLCRASHDUMP=1`) for a
  FULL-memory dump; and `AV reading 0xffffffffffffffff` with RIP on a `jmp`/`call` is a
  **non-canonical control transfer** (`#GP` sets no CR2 → address reported as -1), i.e. a corrupted
  jump-target pointer, not a null deref.

  AMBIGUOUS until matched by module BASE+SIZE** — ours is trivially the ~18 MB one (0x11A9000
  SizeOfImage; stock mods are 64 KB–816 KB); a naive resolver nearly attributed the 19:17 real-env
  crash to the wrong mod. Bonus recipe: a full minidump parse needs no cdb — ~80 lines of Python

- **2026-08-29 — A MECHANISM IS ONLY AS WIDE AS THE CODE THAT CONSULTS IT: three claims died in one
  pass, each taken from a name or a header instead of from the reader.** (1) A security design six
  weeks old rested on `IP_AllowWithoutAuth = 0`; `[V]` that convar is consulted by exactly ONE class
  (`steamnetworkingsockets_udp.cpp:1824-1841`) while the base class allows unsigned certs
  unconditionally (`connections.cpp:1806-1814`) and the P2P class — our primary transport — does not
  override it, so the mechanism could never have hardened the lane it was written for. (2) "GNS proves
  the peer holds the key its cert names" is true and irrelevant: `[V]` `identity_string` and
  `key_data` are independent fields checked against different things (`:1452-1458` vs `:1497`) and
  **nothing compares the two**, so a peer can present a victim's key as its identity and pass every
  library check. (3) `SetCertificate` on a self-issued UNSIGNED cert fails: `[V]`
  `CertStore_CheckCert` returns at its first line (`certstore.cpp:600-605`) and never reaches the
  parse below it, so the caller reads an EMPTY out-message and answers "Cert has invalid public key"
  — an out-parameter filled only on the success path. *Look FIRST:* grep who READS a knob before
  designing on it (the vendored `src/`, not the `include/`), and check whether YOUR lane's class
  overrides the virtual that consults it; if you cannot cite one line where two values are compared,
  the library does not bind them; and read every early return of any checker that both returns a
  verdict and fills a struct. `memory/lesson_a_mechanism_is_only_as_wide_as_the_code_that_consults_it.md`

- **A TICK IS NOT A BRAIN — read what it does before its FIRST branch.** 2026-08-29, ATV arc 1. Parking
  a mirror's brain is this project's standard move, and it is written into the ATV design as a pillar.
  It moved the vehicle: from a byte-identical start a tick-off mirror ended **42.7 cm** away and 37 cm
  lower. `[V]` `ATV_C`'s tick reaches `mesh.SetCenterOfMass(VLerp(..., tirescount/4))`
  **unconditionally, every frame, before any gate** (`ExecuteUbergraph_ATV @29894`) — a centre of mass
  is rig CONFIGURATION the BP re-applies per tick, not a decision. And the things the park was meant to
  stop were already single-peer by the game's own gating: `@29949 IFNOT(isDriven)` guards
  `applyWheelTorque`, every battery term is `SelectFloat(x, 0, isDriven|isDrive|lights|turbo)`. It
  prevented nothing and changed the physics; restoring the tick took horizontal agreement 13.2 cm ->
  0.3 cm. The distinction is not visible in the class name or the property census — only in the
  bytecode. *Look FIRST:* disassemble `ReceiveTick` to its first branch; anything unconditional there
  (`SetCenterOfMass`, `SetMassScale`, a constraint re-place, `AddForce`) is configuration. Then check
  whether what you meant to stop is already locally gated. A mirror that must differ usually needs a
  NARROW cancel at the authoring seam, not a whole-tick switch.

- **2026-08-30 — A BP UFunction can be a DEAD STUB that dispatches perfectly and does nothing.**
  `[V]` `ATV_C::playerSit` writes ubergraph variable `K2Node_Event_player_18` — which appears exactly
  twice in the whole `.uasset`, its declaration and that one write, i.e. **zero readers** — then jumps
  to `ExecuteUbergraph_ATV(9122)`, a bare `EX_PopExecutionFlow`. The compiler kept the event entry
  after its graph was deleted. It resolves by name, is `BlueprintCallable`, builds a ParamFrame,
  dispatches, and returns true. **Four runs across two sessions called it, logged "SIT fired", seated
  nobody**, and the ATV acceptance's whole driven half stayed INCONCLUSIVE for a day because
  `driven=0` right after the call read as "the seat was refused" rather than "the function is empty".
  The live verb was `actionName(player, hit, "sit")` -> uber `@46046`. *Look FIRST:* when a BP call is
  clean and the world does not change, follow `ExecuteUbergraph_<X>(N)` to the statement AT offset N
  before theorising about gates or timing — a stub is `POP->ret` there, a real event is a block — and
  census the ubergraph for the variable the stub writes; zero readers is the proof. Find the real verb
  by grepping for the variable the BODY reads, then MEASURE its gates instead of guessing which
  refused (two of these three were cheap side-effect-free reads and named the answer in one run).
  `memory/lesson_a_dead_stub_reports_success.md`

- **`UWidget::RemoveFromParent` DETACHES a widget; it does not DESTROY it** — `[V]` measured
  2026-08-31 on `blackScreen_C`, a widget the GAME creates (`mainPlayer` uber `@4353`,
  `AddToViewport(0)`): `inViewport 1 -> 0` but **`stillFindable=1`** — `FindObjectByClass` still
  returns the UObject afterwards. So **any "is it gone" check must ask `IsInViewport`, never
  findability**; `docs/DEATH_ARC.md`'s revive had a completion term that asked whether a live
  `blackScreen_C` was findable, which would have read TRUE forever after a perfectly successful
  removal and travelled the player to the menu for a step that had worked. Resolve
  `RemoveFromParent` off the ENGINE `Widget` class (`FindFunction` is exact-owner, no SuperStruct
  climb — `laptop.cpp:128-131`) and `IsInViewport` off `UserWidget`. The probe caught the trap only
  because it reported BOTH facts; one written to answer the question I went in with would have
  looked like a clean pass. (Same run: removing the widget did not perturb the chain — travel at
  10 703 ms vs 10 672 ms with it left in place, so it is a display artifact, not a participant.)

> **"VotvIO repo:" in the pointers below.** Many lessons in this section were paid for by

> this tree to its own repository on 2026-09-02 (it lived at `tools/blender/votvio/` for its

- **A perceived WEIGHT difference is usually CONTRAST — sample the ink before touching a font property.** The user called our native buttons *"жирные ... совсем не как нативный votv"*. Sampling the label ink in their own captures against ours: native `#FF8900`, ours `#FFFFFF` — and corrected for capture scale our glyphs carry LESS ink (114 vs 144 lit px), on the same face, size and outline. The screen was not bolder, it was at maximum contrast; VOTV puts orange on its buttons and reserves white for the window TITLE. "Bold" is a font word, so the search starts at the font and finds nothing there. Also: one mis-placed crop returned grey and would have supported a false "idle is grey, hover is orange" — the fix was to sample a frame with SEVEN buttons visible, not to sample harder. **Look here FIRST:** normalise for capture scale before comparing ink counts, use a frame with many instances to separate per-state colour from global colour, and never adopt a shade sampled off a compressed PNG when a measured palette exists. [[lesson-a-perceived-weight-difference-is-usually-contrast]]

- **2026-08-29 — Cooked UE4 data is DELTA-vs-archetype encoded at every PROPERTY layer; absence
  means "default", never "does not exist".** Five instances bit the VotvIO Blender importer, each
  measured (instance 3 CORRECTED by v5 `42bb819d` the same day): (1) 5,667/10,024 umap SMComponents
  carry no `StaticMesh` property (it lives on the SCS/CDO archetype); (2) an SCS pivot with
  all-default properties has NO template export at all (dish_C `axis_Z`/`axis_Y` exist only as
  SCS_Node graph refs — a tree walk that aborts on a missing template drops the dish head's
  subtree); (3) **CORRECTED: "a placed BP actor exports ONLY its delta components" was FALSE** — the
  umap serializes an export for EVERY component (the attach graph needs them; ChildActor children
  sit in PersistentLevel as `*_CAT_N` actors at live transforms), only the PROPERTIES are delta; the
  tree-first pass built on the false premise double-applied the root transform (the base floated
  61 m) and was deleted whole; (4) a CHILD BP's template export is itself a delta vs the PARENT
  class's template (`ladder_old_C.segment1` has no mesh anywhere — it lives on `ladder_C.segment1`),
  so template inheritance must merge per-PROPERTY, not per-component; (5) UCS-built state (ISM
  instance tails — the tower ladder's 91 rungs) is serialized into the umap deltas, richer than the
  class template's bake — a keyed save row matching a level actor at the cooked transform should
  KEEP the level actor. The trap: delta-only rendering looks MOSTLY right, so it presents as
  scattered per-object weirdness, not one encoding rule — and a wrong layer-3 model produced a whole
  assembly pass that was itself the next bug. *Look FIRST:*

- **2026-08-29 — A runtime-assigned field lives on the CDO VARIABLE (or in bytecode), and the cooked
  component TEMPLATE can be PRESENT and WRONG.** The inverse of the delta-encoding trap: there an
  absent field means "default"; here `grime_beer_C`'s template `DecalMaterial` says the PARENT's
  blood while the CDO variable `material` says `inst_beerSplash` (the BP pushes it into a MID at
  runtime) — and the variant-family classes (crack/leaky/dusty/light/grainy) carry NO material
  anywhere: the BP picks from numbered pak families (`inst_decalCrack_0..16`, `_leak_0..7`,
  `_dirt_0..34`, `_Leaves_1..4`); 739 decals collapsed onto the inherited `dirt_0` before the
  family table existed. Resolution order that ships: variant family → CDO variable → component
  template. *Look FIRST:* `VotvIO repo: votvio/decals.py` (`GRIME_FAMILY`) +

- **2026-08-29 — a cooked UMaterial strips its expression GRAPH, but `CachedExpressionData` keeps
  every runtime parameter's DEFAULT VALUE and the `ReferencedTextures` list.** "These screen
  materials have ZERO texture params so their content is unreachable" was measured TRUE of the
  override arrays and FALSE one property over: `mat_clockMat` names the `digits` atlas + num=0 +
  color=RED, `mat_tvScreen` its static/pixel/content textures + active=1/static=0,
  `mat_analogDS_*` their real display colors (orange/yellow/green) — the v6b white-noise stand-ins
  the user rejected were built on the narrow measurement. For any "what does this material actually
  show" question, dump the raw export and read `CachedExpressionData` (Materials) /
  `CachedReferencedTextures` (MICs) BEFORE declaring content runtime-only. Second dividend (v7e):
  the defaults also expose MEANINGLESS overrides — `mat_object` defaults `ag` to the engine Black
  texture, so a MIC's `emisive_strength` override glows nothing unless `ag` is overridden too
  (151/569 bench materials carried cargo-cult strength) — and the mask is not the last word: the
  ag-gate survivors all carried the SAME cloned lamp mask; the REAL gate is the
  `useEmissive` STATIC SWITCH (banana=false, alamp2_on=true; no chain override = off). Scalar <
  mask < switch — resolve the whole ladder. Third dividend (v8d, CORRECTED by v9): `FunctionInfos`
  names the shaping functions the stripped graph ran — but it is a BAG for the WHOLE graph with no
  wiring; v8d pattern-matched its CheapContrast onto the texture alpha while the real
  CheapContrasts sit over the material's LinearGradients. Fourth dividend (v9): the render-state
  truth lives OUTSIDE the parameter ladder in `BasePropertyOverrides` — every VOTV decal chain
  carries `OpacityMaskClipValue=0.3333` on a BLEND_Translucent MIC and the game HONORS it on
  deferred decals (sub-0.333 alpha draws NOTHING; 74.7% of tex_dirtGrimeOverlay sits there, so the
  raw ramp rendered 257 smoky films the game never shows). Read BasePropertyOverrides before
  inventing any alpha treatment. *Look FIRST:*

- **2026-08-29 — an anonymous save-row value is NAMED by matching it against the class CDO's
  defaults, never by the first visual knob that fits two samples.** Grime primitives json
  `[variant, N]`: N was read as "sizePct" for four waves (oil 300 → drawn 3x, poo 50 → half-size)
  because 90% of rows carry 100 and the misread was invisible on them. Dumping the CDOs showed
  every class's rows persist EXACTLY its CDO `process` default (dyn 110, poo 50, oil 300) and the
  sibling vars hand over the semantics: `process`/`maxProcess`/`cleanParameter:"alpha"` — N is mop
  durability; display opacity = clamp(process/maxProcess) (poo's OWN maxProcess=50, so 50 renders
  FULL); size was never encoded. *Look FIRST:* dump the class CDO (+parents) beside sample rows —
  a row column equal to a CDO property across classes IS that property.

- **2026-08-29 — an inside-out mesh import surfaces only at a NORMALS CONSUMER, and orientation
  is proven on a convex mesh, never by looking.** The UE->Blender Y-mirror alone already flips
  D3D CW-front to Blender CCW-front; `mesh_build`'s extra index swap double-compensated and
  shipped every static mesh inverted through v1..v7c with zero visual symptom (two-sided
  shading) — until `ray_cast`-driven decal projection consumed the normals and put every decal
  13mm INSIDE its wall, facing the cavity (the landscape's independent winding was already
  up-facing, which hid the class: terrain decals worked). The instrument: build a CONVEX mesh
  (`meshes/misc/cube`) and assert 100% of `normal.(center_dir) > 0` — inverted reads 0%, instant
  discriminator; any mirrored-axis importer owes this check before its first normals consumer.

- **2026-08-29 — pyUE4Parse works on VOTV only with 6 named fixes** (it LOOKS broken at the first
  mesh): unconditional `minMobileLODIdx` read for ≥4.27 misaligns every StaticMesh (CUE4Parse gates it
  on `StaticMesh.KeepMobileMinLODSettingOnDesktop`, default OFF); `USkeletalMesh` is a stub — bounds +
  materials only (CLOSED v15: `votvio/sk_model.py` registry-replaces it with a full LOD0 reader);
  `FMeshUVHalf.to_mesh_uv_float()` returns RAW half bits
  (decode via numpy float16 view); the "Could not read StaticMesh" ERROR spam is usually a COSMETIC
  post-LOD-tail failure (geometry already parsed); the export registry extends without forking via
  `register_export(cls, Type=...)` (used for the ISM/HISM `instance_matrices` native tail); and
  (v10) `find_export("Texture2D")` MISSES TextureCube — fall back by type and slice the mip's
  BulkData to `raw[:len//6]` for face 0, while RAW files (`.ufont`) read via
  `provider.get_reader(<full path WITH extension>)` though the file-list keys are extensionless.

- **2026-08-30 — N screens can be ONE canvas — and a face is a SCATTER of UV-island cutouts,
  never a bbox.** All six workstation screen meshes share ONE `mat_tvScreen` on slot "UI"
  sampling the single `ui_consolesAtlas` 2000x2000 canvas — the `umg_console` embed's rect is
  BYTE-EQUAL to the SAT mesh's UV window. Two plausible models (per-pane RTs; per-device cover
  toggles) died before that check, and a THIRD ("quadrant per face") shipped a whole wave
  because a UV **bbox is a union** that hides island structure: the v11 island census
  (union-find over section triangles) showed comp 2 / coords 18 / download 8 / playback 6 /
  console 1 / radar 5 cutouts, the coords counters cut PER DIGIT (3x5 windows of 35x46), and
  faces freely windowing neighbor quadrants. The widget bakes in RenderTransform (comp table
  ROTATED −90, counters shear 7 + LetterSpacing 470/1000 em = the digit-window pitch) and the
  cutout reads the rotated projection. *Look FIRST:* `VotvIO repo: votvio/screens_rt.py`
  docstring (the routing model); census UV ISLANDS, not the bbox, and check RenderTransform
  before trusting a layout rect.

- **2026-08-30 — A hierarchy rule generalizes exactly as far as the family is HOMOGENEOUS —
  census the ancestor's WHOLE descendant set before hanging behavior on it.** The v13 rule
  "every `triggerBase_C` descendant -> hidden Events" was built from a census of `trigger_*`
  NAMES (homogeneous markers), but VOTV bases ALL interactive actors on that class: `door_C`
  x53, `ceilingLamp_C` x41, `lightswitch_C` x42, `passwordLock_C` x14, the garage gate —
  one rule hid every base door. The real discriminator, measured across the family: a WORLD
  class templates its own mesh; a spawner MARKER's mesh arrives only as an umap instance
  delta (the preview of what it will spawn). Second trap: a probe printed each class's OWN
  `Interfaces[]` (empty) while the ACCUMULATED chain carries `int_ttrigger_C` for everyone —
  measure interfaces up the SuperStruct chain. *Look FIRST:* run the descendant census over
  the level before any `is_descendant(X)` rule; `umap_import._is_event_class` + the
  EVENT_ACTOR_CLASSES comment carry the as-built.
  `memory/lesson-a-hierarchy-rule-is-only-as-good-as-the-familys-homogeneity.md`

- **2026-08-30 — A cooked export NAME is not an identity; the ONLY identity is the ExportMap
  index.** The base's door_C actors `door2`/`door3`/`door4` share their names with
  `breakroomCounter_2`'s ChildActorComponents, which sit EARLIER in the export map — a
  name-keyed `by_actor_name` + name-walk `_actor_of` handed the doors' components to the
  counter (wrong class → no template mesh → `no_mesh`), and three of the base's automatic
  doors vanished SILENTLY for ten waves (a collision fails as "asset has no mesh", not as an
  error). `ExportMap[i].OuterIndex` (FPackageIndex, Index>0 → export Index−1) climbed to the
  PersistentLevel export is exact; `by_comp[(name, outer-name)]` is ambiguous the same way —
  keep every candidate and prefer the one on the same actor. *Look FIRST:* on any
  "resolves wrong/nothing" symptom in a cooked package, print EVERY export with that name in
  index order (door_probe5 shape); `umap_import._actor_of`/`_resolve_comp` carry the as-built.
  `memory/lesson-a-cooked-export-name-is-not-an-identity.md`

- **2026-08-30 — Streaky 1D textures = a degenerate UV axis; on a cooked struct parser
  suspect a FIELD SHIFT putting the NORMAL in a texture-basis slot.** The level BSP
  (`Model_0`) textured every surface in grey stripes: `FBspSurf` was unpacked as five ints
  and field [3] — the NORMAL (`Material, PolyFlags, pBase, vNormal, vTextureU, vTextureV,
  ...` = 56 B) — served as the U basis; projection onto the normal is constant per face.
  The convicting probe is `dot(poly normal, Vectors[field])` = 1.000; the real basis dots
  ~0 and carries the texture scale in its LENGTH (~0.2, `/128` stays on unnormalized
  vectors). Streaks read as "wrong material" and the material census confirms plausible
  names — the eye hunts the resolver while the defect is one field earlier. *Look FIRST:*
  test per-face UV span on WIDE faces (thin fan slivers legally span ~0 — gate on world
  span, `verify_v12.py`), then dot the basis field against the normal;
  `VotvIO repo: votvio/bsp_model.py` carries the field list.
  `memory/lesson-streaky-textures-mean-a-degenerate-uv-axis.md`

- **2026-08-30 — Cooked FText has TWO shapes: localized dict and culture-invariant PLAIN
  STRING.** A cooked `Text` property arrives either as `{Namespace,Key,SourceString}` (prose)
  or as a bare string (numbers, `-`, `0 MB`). The atlas painter accepted only the dict, so
  every right-column table VALUE was invisible while labels rendered — it read as "idle by
  design" until the user's in-game shots showed the values present; meanwhile the debug tree
  walker had its own extractor WITH the fallback, so the walk printed what the painter lost.
  *Look FIRST:* every consumer of a cooked `Text` handles `dict | str | None`; when a label
  renders but its value does not, suspect the TEXT SHAPE, not layout.
  `memory/lesson-cooked-ftext-has-two-shapes-dict-and-plain-string.md`

- **2026-08-30 — Rasterizing cooked UMG: point-anchored slots carry SIZE in Offsets.Right/Bottom,
  paint order = the Slots array, and ScrollBox/RetainerBox CLIP.** The size convention is proven
  by the atlas root slot (point anchors + R=2000/B=2000 = the canvas); slot identity is
  (name, OUTER panel) — CanvasPanelSlot_0 repeats. RetainerBox reads like an effect wrapper but
  CLIPS like a scrollbox: the coords space view pans an 11840x5920 sky surface inside one —
  skipped, the space view vanished; recursed unclipped, it FLOODED the whole canvas (both wrong
  states looked fine in crops — verify containers on the FULL canvas). PIL: `alpha_composite`
  refuses negative dest, `paste(im, xy, mask)` allows it. *Look FIRST:*
  `VotvIO repo: votvio/screens_rt.py` `_slot_rect` + `_paint` container branches.
  `memory/lesson-rasterizing-cooked-umg-slots-carry-size-and-retainers-clip.md`

- **2026-08-25 — A converter converts ARTIFACTS, not file extensions.** Asked whether UMG widgets
  authored in UE5 could be downgraded to the 4.27 the shipped game runs, every surface fact says yes:
  UE's refusal to load a newer package is a `FPackageFileSummary` **header** check and patching it is
  a known trick, and third-party *Asset Downgrader* tooling advertises 4.27 and 4.26 as targets. All
  true, and the conclusion is still wrong — **those convert DATA assets** (meshes, materials,
  textures), while a `WidgetBlueprint` is a **compiled `UBlueprintGeneratedClass` with bytecode
  serialized against the compiling engine version**, wrapped around a `UWidgetTree` whose UMG class
  layouts moved across 4.27 -> 5.x. The shared `.uasset` extension is exactly what makes the wrong
  answer sound right: the extension is a container, not a type, so *"tool X handles .uasset"* is
  underspecified in a way that reads as complete. Second trap: the failure arrives **last and
  silently** — not at conversion, but when the shipped game refuses to mount the pak, after the
  editor work, the cook and the package are all done. *Look FIRST:* read the converter's list of
  supported **asset types**, and if it is phrased in extensions that is the smell, not the spec;
  separate DATA from COMPILED (anything with bytecode, a generated class or a serialized graph is
  version-tied in a way meshes are not); and **prefer authoring in the target version over converting
  into it** — here the target engine was already installed with `PythonScriptPlugin` present, so the
  real gap was an *authoring channel* (no MCP supports 4.27), not a format. Fix the channel, not the
  format. `memory/lesson_a_converter_converts_artifacts_not_file_extensions.md`

- **"Unsupported text just shows boxes" is FALSE.** ImGui returns ONE `FallbackGlyph` for EVERY
  absent codepoint (`imgui_draw.cpp:3699-3712`, chosen from `{U+FFFD,'?',' '}`), so two DIFFERENT
  unrenderable strings render IDENTICALLY. **CORRECTED 2026-07-28:** this row also claimed a cmap
  sweep found U+FFFD in `FSEX300` ONLY — that is FALSE, **all seven faces carry it** in their (3,1)
  subtable (the original sweep must have read Roboto's MacRoman table, where it is genuinely absent).
  The fallback really was `'?'`, for a different reason: no glyph RANGE ever asked the atlas for
  U+FFFD, and the builder bakes only what a range names. See the next row. *Look FIRST* before
  designing any graceful-degradation behaviour: `memory/lesson_imgui_missing_glyphs_collapse_to_one_fallback.md`

- **Presence in a FONT is not presence in an ATLAS — a fallback glyph must be ASKED FOR.** Measured
  2026-07-28: all seven embedded faces have U+FFFD, `ImFont::BuildLookupTable` (`imgui_draw.cpp:3700`)
  picks the fallback from `{U+FFFD,'?',' '}` among **baked** glyphs, and
  `GetGlyphRangesCyrillic()` (`:3525`) stops at U+A69F — so nothing ever requested it and the fallback
  fell to `'?'`. The arc-D2 design had asserted that cross-merging the families would supply it;
  merging cannot add a codepoint no range names. **The fix is one range entry.** Corollary that bit
  immediately: once U+FFFD is baked it is a normal character a name may contain, so the nickname fold's
  sentinel had to BECOME U+FFFD — a U+FFFF sentinel would leave `"中"` and `"�"` with different keys
  and identical pixels, the same defect one level down. *Look FIRST:* for any "the font supports X"
  claim about a rendered surface, check the RANGE passed to `AddFont*`, not the cmap — only their
  intersection renders; and assert a design's claimed SIDE EFFECTS directly, because a side effect
  nobody asked the code for is the claim no reviewer checks.
  `memory/lesson_a_fallback_glyph_must_be_asked_for.md`

- **In an ImGui atlas the bill is the MAXIMUM codepoint, not the COUNT.**
  `ImFont::GrowIndex(max_codepoint + 1)` (`imgui_draw.cpp:3669`) allocates `IndexAdvanceX` +
  `IndexLookup` as dense arrays indexed by codepoint — 8 bytes an entry under `IMGUI_USE_WCHAR32`,
  **per deduped face**. Twemoji's cmap ends at U+E007F with ten TAG characters (subdivision-flag
  spelling, uncomposable without shaping); baking them moved the max from U+1FAF6 and the tables from
  **1.04 MB to 7.34 MB per face** — 22.0 MB instead of 3.1 MB on the default config, 36.7 vs 5.2 on the
  worst. Nineteen megabytes for ten codepoints that can only draw as the fallback box. The whole
  Unicode `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point` set is now subtracted from the baked repertoire. *Look FIRST:*
  print `max(cmap)` as well as `len(cmap)` before merging any donor, and for any
  dense-array-indexed-by-key structure ask whether the cost follows the key's RANGE or its COUNT.
  `memory/lesson_the_highest_baked_codepoint_prices_the_whole_atlas.md`
- **Astral text (emoji, CJK ext) is gated by a vendored DEFINE, not by fonts.** `imconfig.h:65` keeps
  `IMGUI_USE_WCHAR32` commented → `ImWchar` 16-bit, `IM_UNICODE_CODEPOINT_MAX 0xFFFF` (`imgui.h:2515`),
  a glyph range cannot express U+1F300, and `imgui.cpp:1512` DROPS the reassembled astral codepoint on
  input. Same family of silent capability bounds: `FT_DISABLE_PNG ON` kills CBDT colour-emoji donors,
  `FT_DISABLE_HARFBUZZ ON` + no ImGui shaping kills ZWJ/skin-tone/FLAG composition. **And you cannot
  edit the file you just read** (2026-07-28): `third_party/imgui` is a git SUBMODULE, so the switch must
  ride a `PUBLIC` compile definition on the `imgui` target as `IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE` does
  (`CMakeLists.txt:106`). It is **not optional for emoji** — 1,232 of Twemoji's 1,418 codepoints are
  astral, so a BMP-only build has no U+1F600 — and it costs **2.94-4.90 MB of permanent host RAM** once
  ONE astral glyph is baked (`GrowIndex(max_codepoint+1)`, `imgui_draw.cpp:3669`; per-PRESENCE, and the
  merged font's cmap ceiling does not leak into it). *Look FIRST — read the defines before pricing
  fonts:* `memory/lesson_imgui_astral_codepoints_need_wchar32.md`
- **Uniqueness enforced on STRINGS is not uniqueness on SCREEN.** Measured 2026-07-28: the nickname
  arbiter suffixes on fold-key equality over `std::wstring`, while `ImFont::FindGlyph`
  (`imgui_draw.cpp:3830-3838`) returns ONE `FallbackGlyph` for EVERY absent codepoint. So 张伟 and 李明
  have distinct keys, get **no suffix**, and draw as the **same nameplate** — the user's literal ask
  ("everyone has a unique nameplate") was false on screen for exactly the players the feature was being
  extended to serve, while every selftest and log reported success. Buying glyphs shrinks the broken set
  but can never close it (Hangul, Thai, rare hanzi always sit outside any budget), so a coverage-based
  guarantee is **budget-shaped**. The fix is a LAYER choice: fold every out-of-repertoire codepoint to
  ONE sentinel in the AUTHORITY, so names that render alike collide and take the suffix that already
  ships — uniqueness becomes font-independent and the donor set demotes to a legibility knob. Also
  recorded there: escaping per codepoint just moves distinctness into the LAYOUT, and folding against
  the live atlas would make one machine's font install the authority for everyone's name. *Look FIRST:*
  when a guarantee is about what a HUMAN PERCEIVES, ask "what renders identically that my key treats as
  different?" and name the layer that can make it TOTAL.

## 7. Performance

- **2026-08-29 -- diff the two INSTALLS before instrumenting either one.** A "the mod costs
  120 -> 70 fps" hunt burned most of a session on new instruments, a bypass A/B and a
  `stat unit` arc before anyone compared the two installs the two numbers came from.
  Multivoid cost **nothing**: same save, byte-identical `main.dll`, both windowed --
  ~75 fps on the dev rig, **~119** once `DebugMod.pak` and the six UE4SS Lua mods in
  `Mods/mods.txt` were gone, and still ~119 with Multivoid loaded, hosting and its own
  paks present. Re-enabling `mods.txt` put it back to ~80 (negative arm, so it is causal).
  Three things hid it: the control `deploy-all.ps1 -Remove` strips only `Mods/Multivoid`,
  which proves the gap is not explained by removing us but says nothing about which
  install the 120 came from; **DebugMod's C++ half fails to load (`0x7f`) while its
  BLUEPRINT half loads fine** via `BPModLoaderMod`, and the UE4SS log said
  `[Lua] DebugMod == table:` the whole time; and the enabled-mod census read
  `Mods/*/enabled.txt` when UE4SS 3.0.1's real list is `Mods/mods.txt`. *Look FIRST:*
  when a perf claim compares two environments, the first artifact is a **diff of the
  environments** -- hash the game exe, list every mounted `.pak`, diff the loader's
  settings AND its enable list, and read the loader's own log for what actually loaded.
  Corollary: a sequential bisect yields only CONDITIONAL deltas -- our own paks "cost
  5 fps" solely because `BPModLoaderMod` was still there to load them, and zero once it
  was not, so re-test a step alone before attributing a number to it.

- **2026-08-25 — a ctx GATE belongs in a hot callback; a ctx RESOLVE does not.** Obeying
  `[[lesson-vm-dispatch-verb-name-is-not-the-gate]]` ("check `av.ctx`'s class") put
  `if (!g_gunClass) g_gunClass = R::FindClass(...)` inside a `vm_dispatch` entry callback. `R::FindClass`
  was an **uncached, negative-unlatched walk of ~237k objects with a name render per object** (2026-08-25
  `ca1cd5e4` gave it the `BeginClassWalk` cache its three siblings already had, so a HIT is now O(1) --
  but a MISS still walks, and this defect was a miss EVERY time, so the case below is exactly the case
  the cache does not help), and
  `prop_coingun_C`'s UClass is not resident in the ordinary world (`[V]` the gun is in 3 of 261 maps),
  so the resolve FAILED and re-walked on **every left click of all 146 `playerHandUse_LMB` classes**.
  `Install` was already retrying the identical resolve inside a ~1 Hz throttle. The fix is
  `if (!g_x) return;` -- compare in the callback, produce in the installer. *Look FIRST:* grep
  `FindClass|FindFunction|FindObjectByClass` inside anything reached per-frame / per-ProcessEvent /
  per-overlap / per-0x45-verb / per-packet / **per-ROW of any list you paint**, and ask what it costs
  in the world where the feature is ABSENT -- an unlatched NEGATIVE turns a memo into a loop.
  **SECOND INSTANCE, 2026-08-26, and the vocabulary above is what missed it:** the native server
  browser's `RowPartsAt` resolves `R::FindFunction(cw, L"GetContent")` **per row, per sync**
  (`server_browser_native.cpp:209`; `:188`/`:361` do the same for `SetContent` per row BUILT). That is
  not per-frame or per-packet, so a grep of this row's own list would not have caught it -- it is
  per-ROW-per-second, and the loop is bounded only by the row count. **`R::FindFunction` has NO result
  cache at all** (`reflection.cpp:485-497`): unlike `FindClass`, which `ca1cd5e4` fixed one day
  earlier, every call walks `NumObjects()` with an `OuterOf` test per object. `[V]` a full walk is
  ~1.1-1.6 ms (`[WALK-TIME] sync:event_cue = 2317/3220 us`, two walks, `NumObjects=182767`), and they
  all land in ONE frame -- so the shape is a **single-frame stall**, and quoting it per-second (as an
  earlier draft did) understates it. **Precision so nobody overclaims the fix:** `BeginClassWalk`
  memoises the class SEARCHED FOR, not the RESULT -- `FindObjectByClass` / `FindObjectsByClass` /
  `FindActorsByClass` all still walk, and `FindClass` caches a result only because its result IS a
  class. A `FindFunction` result cache would be a NEW cache across 476 call sites, not parity with its
  siblings. Design of record: `docs/MULTIPLAYER_UI.md` section 8c.-1.

  metrics in one `/qf`, each blind for a different reason: **p99** for a stall that is 0.17% of frames
  at the shipping cadence (below the 1% cut, so it reports a normal frame either way); a
  **frame-interval p99 on a `GetTickCount64` counter** (~15.6 ms granularity against ~8.5 ms frames --

  instrument that produces neither** (`worldless_frames` counts frames per segment; its `g_maxFrozenMs`
  is about the TASK PUMP). A blind statistic does not error -- it prints a healthy number with the
  authority of a measurement, and the gate built on it passes on a broken build. *Look FIRST:* before
  writing a threshold, answer in order -- how OFTEN is the event as a fraction of samples (rarer than
  the percentile's cut => use `max` + a count over threshold); how BIG against the TIMEBASE's
  resolution (grep the counter for its clock); and does the instrument actually PRODUCE this quantity
  (a counter of events is not a distribution of intervals). Then show it RED with an injected fault.

- **`GetActorLocation`/`GetComponentLocation` are UFunction DISPATCHES, not raw reads** — never bulk-call

- **Per-tick `GUObjectArray` walk: cheap class check BEFORE `NameOf`.** COROLLARY (v114): a

  the Linux triage this produced a false "HITCH-SRC median 74 ms, n=808" (really the [HITCH] frame
  values) and briefly inverted the fps-floor attribution; the clean split showed ONE real HITCH-SRC

  its own comment says "One-shot install ... (idempotent)" but the idempotency is each MODULE's job.
  A module added without its own latch fires ~57x/SECOND (measured: 14,095 identical "armed" lines in
  4 minutes, vs exactly 1 for every latched neighbour). A perf-audit agent classified the same call
  site COLD/boot from its location. *Look FIRST:* `net_pump.cpp:720`; grade a smoke with `grep -c`, not
  `grep`. `memory/lesson_subsystems_install_is_a_per_tick_retry_pump.md`
- **The FString PIN doctrine ("mint engine-side, never free") holds ONLY for FRESH buffers** —

- **An optimisation hoisted ABOVE the bound it was protecting.** To stop never-despawning coins from
  holding the WorldActor pose batch's 28 slots, a delta gate was added -- and computing the delta read
  the transform, moving `GetActorLocation`/`GetActorRotation` above the cap check they used to sit
  below. `[V]` each is a full ProcessEvent dispatch WITH a per-call heap allocation (`ParamFrame`'s
  ctor is documented "per-call, NOT cached"), so a hard 28x2 per tick became 2 per LIVE actor per tick
  at 125 Hz -- ~50k dispatches and ~50k allocs/sec at 200 coins. It bought a bounded resource with an
  unbounded cost. A second defect rode along: recording "last sent" before the truncation check let a
  truncated actor latch its final pose as delivered and freeze its mirror for the session. LOOK FIRST:
  when adding a skip-test to a loop, price the TEST, and place it relative to EVERY existing bound --
  ask what the old worst case was and what the new one is. If the bounded resource really needs
  protecting, fix it INSIDE the bound (fairness / rotating start), not upstream of it.

- **An instrument that times OUR CODE cannot see the engine work our code PROVOKES.** `[V]`
  2026-08-29, hunting a 120 -> 70 fps regression: every bucket we own summed to ~0.6 ms of a
  14 ms frame and could not have said otherwise whatever the answer was. (The regression was NOT
  the mod -- it was the dev machine's own tooling; see the diff-the-two-installs row above -- but
  the blind spots are structural and each rests on its own measurement.) Three of them, each
  found by disbelieving a number,
  not by reading code. (a) The PE detour's self-timer bracketed from INSIDE
  `ProcessEventDetourImpl`, so the outer frame and the SEH `__try` frame were excluded BY
  CONSTRUCTION -- it could never falsify "the detour is the missing time" because it was blind
  to that exact region (the whole-detour timer then EXONERATED it: 255 ns/dispatch). (b) A
  reflected `CallFunction` returns after the ENGINE has run a whole blueprint on the game
  thread; the timer sees the call, the frame pays for the script -- the input-ownership scan
  issued ~9,300/s and appeared in no bucket. (c) A vsync-CAPPED frame makes `stat unit`
  attribution unfalsifiable: the game thread blocks on the sync and `Game` counts the block, so
  every capped frame reads "Game is 97% of the frame". The tell was two processes reporting
  Frame=16.65 ms identical to a hundredth of a millisecond. LOOK FIRST: when our accounting
  cannot explain a regression, stop refining it and run an A/B that makes us INERT --
  `game_thread::SetTransparentBypass(ms)` keeps our actors and threads while killing our
  execution, splitting "what we run" from "what we put in the process" in one 5 s window. Also
  reusable and free: `r.ScreenPercentage 25` (CPU vs GPU) and `r.VSync 0`+`t.MaxFPS 0` before
  any `stat unit`. AND: an instrument in the detour's OUTER frame is OUTSIDE the SEH crash
  firewall -- one placed there hard-crashed the game on its first boot.

- **A RATE LIMITER'S CLOCK BELONGS TO THE WINDOW, NOT THE SEND.** 2026-08-29, ATV arc 1, found by the
  perf audit. `if (window_elapsed && something_changed) { lastSent = now; send(); }` — the `&&` really
  does short-circuit, which is why it reads fine, but bumping the timestamp only on a SEND means the
  quiet case never advances the clock, the gate stays **permanently open**, and the "free" branch runs
  at the pump rate. Measured: the change-gate read is 5 ProcessEvent dispatches + 5 heap allocations,
  so a PARKED ATV cost ~300/s on the host where the previous code did zero — the branch was cheapest
  when it sent and most expensive when it did not. `[V]` MTA does not have this bug and the difference
  is one line's position: `CUnoccupiedVehicleSync::DoPulse:63-68` bumps its clock unconditionally as
  soon as the window elapses. Invisible to `[WALK-TIME]`, which logs only at >= 1000 us. *Look FIRST:*
  write it as two nested statements so the clock's ownership is visible, and when porting a limiter
  diff the timestamp's PLACEMENT specifically — it looks like formatting and is the whole mechanism.

- **THE UE4SS *BUILD* IS WORTH ~48 FPS, AND A 2-ARM TEST COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN IT.** 2026-08-31, user-asked.
  Three arms on one save / one mod build / one install / solo host, each PID-asserted: **old loader + 6
  Lua mods = 70 fps** · **new (shimloader) loader + 5 = 118** · **old loader + 5 = 75**. The new build
  silently fails to start `CheatManagerEnablerMod` (`Failed to find ConsoleManagerSingleton: found 2
  unique values` — its AOB is ambiguous on this exe), so loader and mod-set were CONFOUNDED and the
  2026-08-29 hunt correctly refused to attribute. The third arm settles it: the mod is worth ~5 fps, the
  loader ~48. *Look FIRST:* when a change alters TWO things at once, the arm that holds the suspected
  side-effect constant is not optional — and note the same DLL started all six mods on the user's
  r2modman lane, so the AOB's discriminator is the GAME EXE, not the loader. `docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` §9,
  `memory/project-ue4ss-loader-is-worth-48-fps-2026-08-31.md`
- **AN INSTRUMENT THAT DEFINES THE PHENOMENON BY THE OLD BASELINE ERASES THE FIX.** 2026-08-31. An fps
  harness classified samples as menu-vs-world by `fps < 110` — a threshold read off the OLD loader
  (world ~70, menu 120) that separated the phases perfectly on every log that existed. The new loader
  ran the world at 118, so all 70 in-world samples were filed as "menu" and the run reported `world=0`:
  a large success rendered indistinguishable from "never loaded a map", with no error. *Look FIRST:*
  classify state by a signal INDEPENDENT of the axis you measure — here the `atv_probe` heartbeat
  (`[V]` 0 lines/min in menu, 121-126 in world on the same log). Any threshold whose value came from
  current broken behaviour is a candidate.

- **A SHARED RIG HANDS YOU ANOTHER SESSION'S LOG AT YOUR OWN PATH.** 2026-08-31, clobbered 4x in 8
  minutes. `mp.py` kills EVERY VotV process, so a second session replaces the game under you; the log
  beside the exe keeps existing, stays well-formed, and belongs to THEIR process — one run even had
  `VOTVCOOP_MENU_PROCEED=1` armed and sat in the menu, which would have been reported as an in-world
  result. `game_lock` guards the LAUNCH and cannot stop a session that takes the lock after yours.
  *Look FIRST:* record the PID `mp.py` prints and refuse the arm unless the captured log carries
  `boot: entry=cppmod ... pid=N`; kill only that PID (never `mp.py kill`, which is box-wide); and ABORT
  on `REFUSING to launch` rather than sleeping — otherwise your own cleanup destroys their run.
  `memory/lesson-a-shared-rig-hands-you-another-sessions-log-at-your-own-path.md`
- **TWO TRUE LOG LINES DO NOT MAKE A CAUSAL CHAIN — CHECK THE SHAPE, THE GAP AND THE LAYER.**
  2026-08-31, written and retracted the same day (`docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` §9.3). "`CheatManagerEnablerMod`
  does not start; the reason is in its own log, **not inferred**: `Failed to find
  ConsoleManagerSingleton ... found 2 unique values` — its AOB is ambiguous and it bails." Both halves
  `[V]`; the *because* was invented. The scan is a `[PS]` DLL-level line **1.5 s earlier** with the
  whole Lua phase-2 block between, and above all **the symptom shape is wrong**: "bails" predicts a
  mod that starts then errors, while the log shows one **never enumerated at all** — not even the
  `Mod 'X' disabled in mods.txt.` line that four other mods each get, with its row at `: 1` and its
  folder present. The words "not inferred" advertised it as measured, so nothing re-checked it, and a
  second claim ("the discriminator is the GAME EXE") was built on top and fell with it. A log holding
  one anomaly and one absence invites you to join them. *Look FIRST:* say what the cause's effect
  should LOOK like and compare that to the actual lines (a mod failing mid-start, being skipped, and
  never being seen are three different signatures); then check the time gap and whether the two lines
  even belong to the same subsystem. Reserve "measured" for what the artifact literally states — the
  connective between two quotations is yours, and when it collapses everything above it is
  re-derived, not patched. `memory/lesson-two-true-log-lines-do-not-make-a-causal-chain.md`
- **A `0` READING CAN BE THE ABSENCE OF THE QUANTITY, NOT A LOW VALUE.** 2026-08-31, arm D of the
  UE4SS pin. A run reported `fps=0 (frame=0.00 ms)` for 110 s straight while the gameplay witness kept
  firing at full rate: not a slow game, a **dead render path** — `overlayPresent=0.00/fr(0.0/s)`, the
  present hook never called, game thread alive. Filtering `fps > 0` left 7 usable samples and a
  median of 87 that looked like a plausible, mediocre result and would have been reported as one. The
  arm was recorded VOID and re-run: 118 fps, n=127. *Look FIRST:* before averaging, ask whether the
  instrument's zero means "small" or "did not happen", and find the companion field that separates
  them (here, presents-per-second); and treat a collapse in USABLE sample count as a verdict about the
  run's validity, not a smaller sample to average anyway.
  `memory/project-ue4ss-loader-is-worth-48-fps-2026-08-31.md`
- **A FIT CHECK IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE RECT IT MEASURES AGAINST — and the wrong one fails GREEN.**
  2026-09-01. Two audits predicted a fixed-height window's footer was arranged past its bottom edge,
  so I wrote a probe to settle it. It printed *"footer inside the frame, 239 px of slack"* in both
  lock states. Wrong operand: `NS::BuildWindowShell` returns `root`, which is a **full-screen
  `UUserWidget`** (the scrim fills it), while the window the player sees is a centred `SizeBox` nested
  inside that the shell did not expose — so the probe measured distance to the edge of the SCREEN,
  which is always comfortably positive. Pointed at the real frame it read **FOOTER OUTSIDE THE FRAME
  by 28 px**. The same probe first ran in `Show()`, where Slate has not laid out yet and every rect is
  `0x0`, printing `overflow=0` — a second plausible pass. *Look FIRST:* name BOTH operands of a
  containment probe and scrutinise the one you did not choose deliberately; treat an all-zero rect as
  not-yet-laid-out, not as a value; and do not trust such a probe until it has printed a real failure
  once. A probe that measures against a container larger than the one you mean passes forever.
  `memory/lesson-a-fit-check-is-only-as-good-as-the-rect-it-measures-against.md`
- **A MISSING RESULT INDICTS YOUR INVOCATION BEFORE IT INDICTS THE ENVIRONMENT.** 2026-09-01.
  `mp.py browser` printed every driven phase as `UNMEASURED`, twice, and I handed off *"the driven
  phases do not run in this environment"* — then shipped a UI change on `screen built` alone. False:
  the phases need **`--fake-master N`** (the live master's ~2 rows do not carry the run to step two),
  and they had passed on that same box hours earlier. A post-ship audit caught it by reading
  `research/browser_shots/*.png` timestamps against `ignore_folder/_FRIENDLY_SESSION.txt`. Raising
  `--duration` "confirmed" the wrong theory, because the run was ending on a verdict-silence heuristic
  that no duration knob outranks. Re-run with the flag: ten phases PASS, and the same run measured a
  real 28 px layout defect the "unmeasurable" verdict had let me ship. *Look FIRST:* `ls -la` the
  output dir for a dated artifact (a working invocation you can copy), read the working command out of
  the friendly-session log rather than the docs, and check the STOP REASON rather than the duration.
  Write "I did not get it to run", never "it cannot run here" — the second is inherited as a fact
  about the rig. `memory/lesson-a-missing-result-indicts-your-invocation-before-the-environment.md`

## 8. Build / deploy / git hygiene

- **EXTRACTING CODE INTO ITS OWN REPO IS A FIDELITY TEST FOR EVERY CONSTANT THAT NAMES THE OUTSIDE WORLD.** `[V]` 2026-09-02, moving the VotvIO Blender addon out of `tools/blender/votvio/`: its game auto-detect listed `D:\Projects\Programming\VOTV_MP\Game_0.9.0n_HOST\WindowsNoEditor` among three fallback roots. It survived 28 commits and every bench run because **inside this tree it was true** — the folder really was one directory up, on the only machine that ran it — and correctness is what a reader checks. Shipped to a stranger it is one dead string protecting two lucky guesses. The same read found a second defect of a different kind: that search is reached from `AddonPreferences.draw()`, which Blender calls **per UI redraw**, while statting hundreds of paths — invisible while the list was 3 entries and the first one hit instantly on the dev box. **Look here FIRST:** when code leaves the tree it grew in, grep the extracted half for the OLD repo's name and for any absolute path (a hit is a finding, not a false positive), then re-check every manifest URL, then rewrite the docs' internal paths and *annotate* rather than break any citation that stays external — and while you are in those functions anyway, ask who calls each one and how often. Prove the move rather than assume it: compare every (path, blob hash) pair of the split tree against the source subtree BEFORE deleting the original, then re-run the project's own acceptance bench from the new location (here: 1209/406/979/0, the exact recorded v16 signature). [[lesson-extraction-is-a-fidelity-test-for-constants-that-name-the-outside]]

- **A HEREDOC THROUGH THIS TOOL EATS ONE BACKSLASH LEVEL -- and the corruption is INVISIBLE in every view except `repr()`.** `[V]` 2026-09-01, twice. A quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) is supposed to pass its body byte-for-byte; here it drops one level of escaping. First instance was loud (`.replace('\\', ...)` arrived as `'\'` -> SyntaxError). The second was not: I sent `r"\\b"` meaning a regex word boundary, it arrived as `r"\b"` inside a single-quoted Python string, and **`\b` there is the BACKSPACE character U+0008** -- so the pattern became `<BS>HandleWorldEvent...`, matched nothing, and my new CI gate reported all five family dispatchers as "never CALLED": a real, alarming failure with a fictitious cause. `sed -n 'Np'` printed it as `r""`, because a backspace renders as nothing, so staring at the line taught me nothing and I started theorising about scope instead. **Look here FIRST:** never put a backslash inside a heredoc through this tool -- use `BS = chr(92)` and concatenate, or write the file with the Write tool, which is byte-exact; and when a string check inexplicably matches nothing, `repr()` the line BEFORE theorising, since `cat`/`sed`/the editor all render control characters as nothing. Note `'\b'` is a live trap even without a heredoc: in a non-raw Python string it is a backspace and it does not error. [[lesson-a-heredoc-through-this-tool-eats-one-backslash-level]]

- **POPPING AN ENV VAR DOES NOT DISARM A LAYERED FLAG -- it uncovers the ini underneath.** `[V]` 2026-09-01: `launch_peer` kept a world-mutating probe out of every scenario with `env.pop("VOTVCOOP_LIGHTSWITCH_PROBE", None)`, copying the idiom from the two `VOTVCOOP_DEATH_*` switches directly above it. Those are read by a raw `ReadEnv` and have no registry row, so for them a deletion really is a disarm. This one is a config-registry FLAG, and `PickRawLayered` falls through env -> ini: the HOST install still carried `lightswitch_probe=1` from an earlier debugging run, so **every smoke armed the mutating one-shot while I was citing those smokes as clean evidence** -- it fired at 16:01:19 and the client was accepted into PENDING at 16:01:20. **Look here FIRST:** grep the name in `config_registry_rows.inc` before disarming it -- a row there means env is only the TOP layer; override with a VALUE (`env[NAME] = "0"`), never an absence; and prove containment with one grep of the peer's log for the instrument's own tag after the run (0 occurrences is the proof, "we popped it" is not). Persistent config also outlives the session that wrote it, on one install only, which makes it a rig-asymmetry bug as well. [[lesson-popping-an-env-var-does-not-disarm-a-layered-flag]]

- **A BINARY'S THIRD-PARTY NOTICES CENSUS IS BY OBJECT FILE, NOT BY VENDORED DIRECTORY — and a licence with an appendix stops being that licence.** 2026-08-30 (`52ae6afc`). `GameNetworkingSockets/src/external/` vendors picojson and sha1-wpa; `[V]` NEITHER compiles into `main.dll` (zero objects), while abseil, webrtc-lite and both donna curves do — a directory listing would have made a legal file state something false about the shipped binary. Two siblings from the same dig: GitHub reported our licence as **"Other"** because verbatim MIT carried a "Scope notes" appendix (licensee matches the whole file — the notes moved to `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and detection returned), and the Twemoji CC-BY attribution claimed satisfaction "by this file shipping beside the font in the SOURCE TREE" — true of the repo, false of the release zip, which carried neither. **Look here FIRST:** build the component list from `find build/ -iname "*.obj"`/`.lib`, CONCATENATE the licence files from disk (never retype), quote the in-source declaration for a component with no LICENSE file (`curve25519-donna/README.md`: "Public Domain, or MIT"), put the FTL's required FreeType credit at the top, and make the packager fail CLOSED without the notices file. [[lesson-a-binary-notices-census-is-by-object-file-not-by-vendored-dir]]

- **An IDENTIFIER in a handoff is a MEASUREMENT — paste it from output, never type it from expectation.** After a `filter-branch --msg-filter` I reported a parallel session's new commit SHA as `2ac16d9f`. They checked: `git cat-file -t` → **`fatal: Not a valid object name`**. Not stale, not truncated — never a commit. The real value was `f45827a8`, and a SECOND commit had moved that I reported nothing about. The rewrite had echoed the OLD sha it was processing; I printed the corrected MESSAGE and the new branch HEAD, neither of which is the commit in question, and wrote a plausible value between two real ones. **A reader can sanity-check prose and cannot sanity-check a SHA** — it has no structure, no plausibility gradient, no units to be off by, so it is accepted and dangles silently later. Applies to every opaque identifier in a handoff: commit SHA, DLL hash, lobby id, PID, eid, offset, build number. **Look here FIRST:** after any history rewrite print the WHOLE range (`git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`) and quote it verbatim rather than reporting the one commit you believe moved; and remember that a message whose OTHER values are all measured is not a measured message — the true numbers camouflage the invented one. [[lesson-an-identifier-in-a-handoff-is-a-measurement]]

- **A gate that reads the WORKING TREE cannot see unstaged — a green verdict can rest on code that is not in the commit.** The browser parity gate printed `[ok] locked-lobby marker ... (server_browser_rows.cpp)` and that file was not in the pathspec of the commit that shipped the gate: true about my disk, false about the repository. It compounds with a fact this project has now been bitten by three times in one day — **`git commit -- <path>` commits the WORKING TREE state and BYPASSES the index**, so careful `git apply --cached` staging is silently discarded, and another session's lines in the same file ride along. **Look here FIRST:** run `git status` before believing a source-scanning gate's PASS (a green gate plus a dirty tree is not a green gate), and verify a pathspec commit with `git show --stat HEAD` rather than trusting the list you typed. [[lesson-a-gate-that-reads-the-working-tree-cannot-see-unstaged]]

- **HEADLESS-CHROME SCREENSHOTS: THE RIG LIES BELOW 500px, ON vh, ON file:// AND ON #anchor.**
  2026-08-30 (the site Download redesign). Old-headless `--screenshot` lays pages out at a
  ~500px MINIMUM window width and crops the PNG to the requested 400 -- a clean page reads as
  "cut off on the right" and an hour went into DPR/nav/table theories before a 500px control
  shot settled it; a tall `--window-size` inflates every vh-sized section (the hero ate ~13k
  px); `file://` drops root-absolute `/css/...` (unstyled white page); `#anchor` does not
  scroll. And the preview `http.server` holding `public/` fails `zola build` with os error 32.
  The recipe that works: cut the section out of the BUILT page, wrap it standalone with a
  viewport meta + a localhost stylesheet link, shoot at the real viewport; kill the server
  before building. *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson-headless-chrome-screenshot-rig-pitfalls.md`.

- **CMAKE `if(<var>)` EATS A LEGITIMATE "0" -- AND THE FLAWED GUARD ARRIVED WITH TWO ENDORSEMENTS.**
  2026-08-28 (WP-2 commit 3 follow-up). The new major/minor parse guard shipped as
  `if(NOT CMAKE_MATCH_1)`, mirroring the working `kProtocolVersion` guard AND matching the post-ship
  audit's own suggested fix -- and `[V]` it refused the REAL target: `"0.9.0n"` yields major `"0"`,
  which CMake truthiness treats as FALSE, so the FATAL_ERROR fired on the value it existed to accept
  (the sibling never hit this because a build number is never 0). An endorsement count is not
  evidence; only running the guard on the value it must PASS is. Fixed to
  `if("${_votvcoop_tgt_mm}" STREQUAL "")`, shown GREEN on `0.9.0n` + RED on `vNEXT` before commit.
  *Look FIRST:* any new fail-closed guard gets BOTH arms drilled before it is trusted; in CMake a
  parse-result check must use `STREQUAL`/`MATCHES`, never bare truthiness (`0/OFF/NO/FALSE/N/IGNORE/
  NOTFOUND/empty` are all falsy). Full note:
  `memory/lesson_cmake_zero_is_falsy_drill_the_guard_on_the_real_value.md`.

- **A FORMAT FLIP MUST STILL RENDER THE PUBLISHED ERA -- KEY THE ERA ON ARTIFACT DATA, NEVER A FLAG.**
  2026-08-28 (C3.3 `d693609b`). The release lane's asset shape flipped to ONE zip, but `[V]`
  `LEDGER.tsv` holds LIVE two-DLL releases (b125..b133) and `notes_regen.ps1` lawfully REBUILDS a
  live body via the one writer (it backfilled b126/b127 once) -- a zip-only writer would make a
  regenerated old body describe assets its own page does not have. RULE 2 does NOT apply: the old
  shape is not a replaced code path, it is the renderer for artifacts already in the wild (same class
  as the predecessor scan). Shipped: `New-ReleaseBody` decides the era from what the sha map HOLDS
  (one `*.zip` = zip prose on the live anchors; the DLL pair = FROZEN legacy literals; anything else
  THROWS), and `tag_regex_selftest` carries fixtures for both eras + a neither-era refusal. *Look
  FIRST:* before flipping any writer whose output is published, enumerate who can lawfully RE-RUN it
  over old outputs (writer's callers + the ledger's live eras). Full note:
  `memory/lesson_a_format_flip_must_still_render_the_published_era.md`.

- **AN EARLY RETURN INHERITS EVERYTHING THE BRANCH HAD LEFT TO DO -- AND THE BROKEN CODE IS NOT IN THE
  DIFF.** 2026-08-26. The admission gate needed the GNS `Connected` branch to stop seating a peer, so I
  added an early `return` for parked connections and moved the lane-config call I knew about. `[V]` The
  smoke failed as *"client never reached connected"*, and the two logs together named it: host
  `"ADMITTED pending conn -> slot 1"`, client **no** `"host assigned us peer slot"` line at all. The
  host's `AssignPeerSlot` send lives ~50 lines further down the SAME branch I had returned from, after
  the lanes-configured store and a send-buffer mirror. The peer was admitted, held slot 1, had lanes,
  and was never told. **An early return is invisible in review as a deletion, because nothing is
  deleted** -- the diff shows a `return` added and the ~50 lines it now skips are unchanged, so they
  never appear; and skipping a send is not a type error. Fixed by EXTRACTING
  `Session::FinishPeerConnected(slot, hConn)` -- one definition, two callers -- because copying the
  block would have been the same site-list mistake one level down. *Look FIRST:* before adding an early
  return to an existing branch, read that branch to its END and list what it still does past your
  return point (each item is now either dead for your case or owed by your new path -- there is no
  third option); when two paths owe the same trailing work, extract rather than copy; and read a
  "never connected" failure as possibly *connected but never TOLD* -- an authority-side success line
  with no acknowledgement on the other side means the information never crossed.

- **A DELETION COMMIT OWES A CENSUS IN ITS MESSAGE, NOT JUST THE DELETION.** 2026-08-26, found by a
  `/qf` critic. `docs/security/TRACKER.md` A2 records *"the false comment is DELETED (`6f0c2bf8`)"*,
  and that commit's own subject reads `+ 2 false comments`. `[V]` A **second live copy of the same
  false assertion** was still shipping five weeks later: `coop/net/lobby_client.h:41`,
  `bool locked = false; // passworded (UI hint; gate is the game-layer join-secret)`. `6f0c2bf8`
  deleted the copy in the Rust master and never touched this one, and `[V]` a tree-wide grep for
  `join[_]?secret` returns **one hit** -- a future-work marker at `coop/net/session.h:104` -- so the
  gate both comments asserted has never existed anywhere. The structural problem: **a deletion
  message names what it REMOVED and cannot report what it MISSED**, so "2 false comments" is
  unfalsifiable afterwards -- there is no artifact saying what pattern was searched or how many sites
  it matched. The miss then propagates: A2's status line inherited the commit's scope claim verbatim,
  so a census nobody ran became a fact in the security tracker. Same family as **W11** (a
  byte-identical `SanitizeUtf8` copy living inside a file that already included the module claiming
  sole ownership) and `sdk_profile_names.h:446` (a "not cloned" comment about the wrong object) --
  three instances of *a completeness claim no one measured, repeated downstream until it read as
  established*. *Look FIRST:* write the census INTO the message -- `grep -rn '<pattern>' -> 3 hits,
  2 removed, 1 kept` is falsifiable, "+ 2 false comments" is not; when a doc cites a commit for a
  completeness claim, treat that as a claim about the commit's SCOPE (the one thing commits do not
  record) and re-run the search before re-asserting it; and include `--include=*.rs`, because this
  defect spanned the C++ tree and the Rust master and a C++-only grep would have found only the
  survivor. `memory/lesson_a_deletion_commit_owes_a_census.md`


- **"Ask before push" assumes ONE session owns the push** (2026-08-25, two Claude sessions in one
  working copy). I obeyed the rule exactly — six commits, zero pushes — and three of my commits reached
  the **public** origin anyway, inside the *parallel* session's push, un-audited. `git push` publishes
  the **branch**, not a session's commits: the rule's unit is a session, git's unit is a branch, so with
  two sessions **my commit is the other session's push-in-waiting**. Audited after the fact and clean
  (two intentionally-public files, no IPs/keys/ignored paths) — but the audit ran *after* publication,
  which is the ordering the rule exists to prevent. LOOK HERE FIRST: when a second session shares the
  working copy, **treat COMMIT as the publication boundary** and run the leak axes before `git commit`;
  ask up front which session owns the push. The tell is `git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD`
  **moving down without your push**. This adds a precondition to the standing rule, it does not weaken
  it. `memory/lesson_ask_before_push_assumes_one_session_owns_the_push.md`

- **2026-08-25 — Measuring a tool's OUTPUT and recording it as its INPUT. The doc even said
  "measured", and it was — of the wrong artifact.** `UE4SS_ARC.md` §7.2, *"The package shape —
  measured from a real VOTV UE4SS C++ mod"*, was read off the extracted r2modman profile
  (`...\profiles\Default\shimloader\mod\acitulen-DebugMod\`), a directory that genuinely exists and
  holds exactly what was written down. **But that is the install's output; the zip is its input**, and
  the manager performs three transformations the record had un-done none of: it **inserts**
  `shimloader/` (profile root) and `<Author>-<Name>/` (from `mod.getName()`), and **strips** the
  matched folder's own name (`mod/`). So §7.2's tree put `dlls/` at the zip root — where the rule
  engine, finding no matching route, recurses in, fails to match `.dll` on any extension rule, falls
  to `isDefaultLocation`, and `installSubDir` copies it **by basename** to `Mods/<pkg>/main.dll`.
  UE4SS scans `Mods/<name>/dlls/main.dll`. **The package installs successfully, appears in the
  manager, and the mod never loads — no error anywhere**, so the first report would have been a
  player saying it does nothing. It survived a second pass too: §7.1 said the manager *"extracts it
  whole"*, which is the error stated outright, and read as fact for two days. *Look FIRST:* when a
  tool transforms an artifact, write down the TRANSFORMATION before the shape — what does it add,
  strip, rename? Then subtract. Prefer the input when it is obtainable (`unzip -l` on the five real
  packages answered this in one command). Hunt for the transformer's own TESTS — r2modman ships
  `Shimloader.Tests.spec.ts`, which asserts every source→destination pair and is the cheapest
  authoritative spec there is. And suspect any sentence containing *"extracts it whole"* / *"just
  unpacks"* / *"1:1"*: those claim a transformation is the identity, and they are rarely checked.
  `memory/lesson_measuring_the_output_and_recording_it_as_the_input.md`

- **2026-08-25 — A plugin's real ABI coupling is in its IMPORT TABLE, not in the framework's
  headers.** Asked what D-3's "slim C-ABI contract" actually buys, the instinct is to read UE4SS's
  SDK — which answers *what is available to bind*, an upper bound shared by every consumer, and
  cannot tell a mod using two entry points from one using 130. Parsing the PE import/export tables of
  three shipped VOTV mods answered it as a number: `Moddy-CrashContext` **32**, `Moddy-PBMovement`
  **40**, `acitulen-DebugMod` **130** MSVC-mangled C++ symbols imported from `UE4SS.dll` — with
  `std::` types crossing the DLL boundary (`?on_dll_load@CppUserModBase@RC@@UEAAXV?$basic_string_view@_WU?$char_traits@_W@std@@@std@@@Z`)
  — versus Multivoid's **0**. Their binding surface is (this UE4SS build) x (this MSVC STL): an
  upstream signature change is a *missing import*, so the loader fails the DLL outright with no
  degraded mode, which is why the whole cohort pins `unreal_shimloader-1.1.7`. Free finding in the
  same glance: all three link the **dynamic** CRT (`MSVCP140`/`VCRUNTIME140`/`api-ms-win-crt-*`) and
  therefore need the VC++ redist; we link static (`CMakeLists.txt:186,691`) and do not — a
  player-facing install fact invisible to source review. *Look FIRST:* for any "how coupled is X to
  Y" / "will this upgrade break us" question about a shipped binary, parse the import table, and
  compare **against the field** rather than only against yourself. No `objdump`/`strings` on this box
  is not a blocker — the PE walk (DOS header → `e_lfanew` → optional-header data directories →
  RVA-to-offset via the section table) is ~40 lines of PowerShell `[BitConverter]` with no dependency.

- **2026-08-24 — Project prose that lives OUTSIDE the repo tree cannot be censused, and it is the
  most public prose you have.** The UE4SS arc's stale-loader-prose census
  (`votv-ue4ss-stale-loader-prose-CENSUS-2026-08-22.md`, ~139 rows) was complete over FILES and
  structurally blind to the GitHub repo's own About blurb, which still reads *"a standalone C++
  DLL"* — the exact claim the D-3 migration falsifies — plus a `dll-injection` topic, and an **empty
  `homepageUrl`** while `multivoid.dev` has been live since 2026-07-19. The user raised it; no
  instrument could have. Everything this project trusts for drift — `grep`, the CI gates,
  `ledger_lint`, `/documentize` Step 0.5 — operates on the working tree, so a field in GitHub's
  database produces no diff and cannot go stale loudly. The census was not sloppy: its scope silently
  equalled "what a grep can reach". *Look FIRST:* the off-tree surface list, kept in
  `docs/UE4SS_ARC.md` §7.0 — GitHub description/topics/homepage
  (`gh repo view --json description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics`), the Thunderstore package
  description (write it correct the first time), the hand-deployed `site/` copy, Discord topic +
  pins, the release-body template. Sequencing rule: a public "what this IS" statement flips **with**
  the release that makes it true, never before — except a field already wrong on its own terms.
  `memory/lesson_project_prose_outside_the_repo_tree_is_uncensusable.md`

- **2026-08-24 — A running total stated in prose inside an APPEND-ONLY register is stale by
  construction.** `docs/security/TRACKER.md` narrated its own size in three dated notes — "15 OPEN"
  (07-20) → "Now 16 OPEN" (07-23) → "Still 16 OPEN" (07-24) — while rows kept landing (`A8 A9 W7 W8
  W9 W10 A7 S2` among them). Appending a table row is not the same edit as rewriting a paragraph
  three screens up, so nothing ever recomputed it. Thirty days later "16 OPEN" was quoted into
  the local-only docs-arc note twice, a `.gitignore` rationale block and a **public commit message** before a
  census ran: **33 rows — 18 OPEN, 12 BUILT, 1 DESIGN, 1 VERIFIED, 1 DISMISSED** (a neighbouring doc
  carried a third frozen figure, "20 OPEN", from the 2026-07-20 audit). The trap is that every note
  was honest *on its own date*, the file looks maintained, and quoting the number feels like citing
  the source rather than inheriting an inference. **The project had already paid for this exact shape
  in another domain** — `CLAUDE.md`'s modular file-size rule ("catalog is auto-generated, not
  hand-maintained; hand-curated catalogs go stale fast", after one listed `harness.cpp` at 3,126 LOC
  long past its cut to ~778). Second domain = generalise (`[[feedback-recurring-bug-is-architectural]]`).
  *Look FIRST:* never write an aggregate in prose in a document designed to grow — write the COMMAND,
  or a dated snapshot line with the command beside it; and recompute any count before quoting it
  outward, since a count is the cheapest measurement there is.
  `memory/lesson_a_running_total_in_an_append_only_register.md`

- **A CRT `_s` "safe" variant can be the DANGEROUS one inside an injected DLL.** Measured 2026-07-28:
  `_vsnprintf_s_l` routes a malformed conversion specifier (`%q`) to the CRT invalid-parameter handler,
  which raises `__fastfail` — the probe **terminated, exit 127**, where plain `_snprintf_l` printed
  `bad q here` and carried on. `__fastfail` is not an SEH exception, so `RenderFrameGuarded`'s `__try`
  and every per-callback wrapper in this mod are structurally unable to contain it, and a logging typo
  could kill a player's game. Compounding: no `_set_invalid_parameter_handler` exists in the tree, and
  `log.h`'s `Write` has no `_Printf_format_string_` SAL annotation, so MSVC never checks a format
  string against its arguments. Note the shape — **the compiler's own C4996 tells you to make this
  change.** *Look FIRST:* read any `_s` variant as "what does it do INSTEAD of the bad thing?" — if the
  answer is `__fastfail`/`abort`, it converts a local defect into a crash of a process we do not own.
  Suppress C4996 at the call site with the reason.
  `memory/lesson_a_safer_crt_variant_can_be_the_dangerous_one.md`

- **`LC_ALL` is not "the UTF-8 one" — a locale is wider than the conversion you wanted.** Measured
  2026-07-28: `_create_locale(LC_ALL, ".UTF-8")` was reached for to fix `%ls` and also moved
  `LC_NUMERIC`, so on this ru-RU machine every `%f` in the log became `1,50` — 301 `UE_LOG*` sites
  carry a float and `mp.py`/`coverage.py`/`roster_shot.ps1` parse those numbers, so two testers on
  different Windows languages would produce logs that no longer diff. `".UTF-8"` names only a CODE
  PAGE; language/country come from the OS user default for every category `LC_ALL` covers.
  **`LC_CTYPE` alone fixes `%ls` identically** (measured `n=9` both ways) and leaves numerics at `"C"`.
  Two independent audit agents flagged it, neither asked about locales — after the change had already
  passed a build, four selftests and a 4-peer smoke. *Look FIRST:* name the narrowest locale CATEGORY
  that does the job, and diff a REAL artifact before/after rather than only the case you were fixing.
  `memory/lesson_a_locale_is_wider_than_the_conversion_you_wanted.md`

- **Deletable platform objects (git tags, GitHub releases) cannot hold an append-only invariant** — a
  yanked tag silently frees its "consumed" build number for different bytes; record consumption in an
  append-only LEDGER file on the protected branch (repo's own history = the only mechanically
  append-only store), demote tags/releases to drift detectors, and record the negative states
  (burn/retracted) as rows — absence must never encode a state the invariant distinguishes.
  Sharpened 2026-07-25 R17-21: record the positive closure too (`published` row); TERMINAL rows are
  PUSH-IMMEDIATE (until on origin the invariant rides the deletable API); ledger owns "MAY publish",
  the release object owns "did THIS tag complete" (own work product, not a gate). Look FIRST:
  `research/findings/tooling/votv-ci-autobuild-dev-release-DESIGN-2026-07-25.md` §3 D3.
  `memory/lesson_deletable_platform_objects_cannot_hold_append_only_invariants.md`
- **A fetch-push of untrusted content EXECUTES its workflows** — mirroring a fork PR branch into the
  base repo is itself a push event: a contributor-added `on: push` workflow runs at that instant with
  base-repo token capabilities (an explicit `permissions:` key elevates past the read-only default,
  measured). Gate the PUSH, not a later dispatch: sanitize-by-default (mirror script replaces
  `.github/workflows/` with main's copy; explicit -KeepWorkflows after line-by-line review). Also
  measured verbatim: a run executes the EVENT commit's YAML; workflow_dispatch requires the file on
  the DEFAULT branch. Look FIRST: the CI design doc §3 D1 + §2.
  `memory/lesson_fetch_push_of_untrusted_content_executes_its_workflows.md`
- **Drills must run the REAL gate on REAL identifiers** — a fake test namespace (build numbers
  b9000+) violated the gate's own preconditions (proto==N unreachable), so every drill refused on
  the wrong branch and masked the branch under test; MUST-PASS drills were impossible; the terminal
  `drill` row class made the publish drill self-refuse. Fix: real numbers via the real ritual +
  a NO-short-circuit labeled verdict vector (each drill asserts its NAMED line; a fused guard makes
  a drill indiscriminate — the robot-tag drill had to declare contents:write to reach the ruleset
  under test) + stated-and-CHECKED preconditions + a positive control for zero-assertions + a
  cleanup step whose misses fail closed. Look FIRST: the CI design doc §4 + §3 D3. (Validated
  2026-07-25: the executed matrix caught a REAL workflow bug on its first campaign — the no-op
  exit-code fall-through below.) `memory/lesson_drills_must_run_the_real_gate_on_real_identifiers.md`
- **A GH Actions pwsh step exits with the last CHILD's `$LASTEXITCODE`** — even after your script
  HANDLED that code in a switch and fell through to script end (the Actions shell wrapper propagates
  it). A special-exit-code protocol (judge exit 10 = ALREADY_PUBLISHED no-op) needs an EXPLICIT
  `exit 0` on every mapped branch, else the designed-green path runs red and every `needs:`-dependent
  job silently skips. Caught live by the double-dispatch drill; fixed `e4c5e503`. *Look FIRST:*
  `.github/workflows/release-core.yml` judge step.
  `memory/lesson_gha_pwsh_step_exits_with_last_child_code.md`
- **2026-08-29 — systemd `EnvironmentFile` takes NO inline comments.** Appending
  `COOP_MAX_BUILD=143  # note` to `/etc/coop-master.env` made the value parse as `"143  # note"` →
  `env_int` fell back to 0 → the freshly deployed master version gate ran silently DISARMED while
  `systemctl is-active`, `/healthz` AND the GREEN curl were all green — only re-firing the RED case
  after restart caught it. *Look FIRST:* env-file comments on their OWN line; verify a deploy-config
  gate by firing its RED case (`journalctl` shows the refusal line), never by service liveness. Same
  class as the CMake-falsy-"0" drill rule: drill the arm you deployed.
  `memory/lesson_systemd_environmentfile_takes_no_inline_comments.md`
- **2026-08-29 — A PIPED BUILD'S EXIT CODE IS THE PIPE'S, NOT THE BUILD'S (the bash twin of the pwsh
  last-child row above).** `cmake --build … | tail` and `… | grep` both reported rc 0 while the COMPILE HAD FAILED
  (tail/grep exit last); the smoke that followed then deployed + green-lit the STALE previous link —
  a green smoke after a silently-failed build launders old bytes as new. *Look FIRST:* prefix
  `set -o pipefail;` on every piped build/verify (or read `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`), and require the
  `→ main.dll` link line / a changed artifact hash before smoking "new" bytes.
  `memory/lesson_a_piped_builds_exit_code_is_the_pipes.md`
- **PowerShell defaults are case-INSENSITIVE everywhere** (`-match`, `-eq`, `-contains`,
  `-notcontains`, AND hashtable keys) — three separate instruments bitten in one day (2026-07-25):
  the tag fixture caught `-DEV` matching; the verdict-diff `@{}` collapsed `Player_Guid`/`player_guid`
  into a FALSE product alarm; `-notcontains` dropped case-twin keys. Instruments over case-sensitive
  artifacts use `-cmatch`/`-cnotmatch`/`-ceq` + `Dictionary(StringComparer.Ordinal)`. *Look FIRST:*
  `tools/release/tag_regex_selftest.ps1` (the fixture shape that catches it cheaply).
  `memory/lesson_powershell_defaults_are_case_insensitive_everywhere.md`
- **PowerShell UNWRAPS a one-element result — wrap it in `@()` at the CALL SITE** (the `@()` inside the
  helper does not survive the return). Bit two instruments in one hour (2026-07-27): on 5.1 a bare
  `[pscustomobject]` has NO `.Count` (yields `$null`, pwsh 7 yields 1) so `peerconn_gate.ps1` accused
  its own detectors; and `$a + $b` on two bare `MatchInfo` throws `op_Addition`, which killed
  `replacement_drill.ps1`'s grading pass AFTER its `finally` had torn down the peers being graded.
  Corollary: put teardown AFTER grading, or make grading re-runnable off the logs on disk.
  `memory/lesson_powershell_unwraps_one_element_results.md`
- **Ruleset `update` restriction on main: direct pushes AUTO-bypass, PR merges need `--admin`** —
  with RepositoryRole-admin bypass_mode=always, `git push` prints "Bypassed rule violations" and
  sails; `gh pr merge` refuses ("base branch policy prohibits the merge") until `--admin`. So the
  robot-blocking push restriction costs the daily direct-push flow NOTHING; budget `--admin` per rare
  PR. Measured live on ruleset 19728708. 2nd surface (2026-07-25, the b126-dev push): the v-tags
  creation restriction prints "Cannot create ref due to creations being restricted" yet the SAME
  push output shows `* [new tag]` — the scary prose is the rule-evaluation notice; trust the
  ref-update lines. *Look FIRST:* `docs/RELEASE.md` invariants + CI design D7.
  `memory/lesson_ruleset_update_restriction_pushes_bypass_merges_need_admin.md`
- **PS comma binds TIGHTER than `+`: a concat inside an array literal silently array-appends** —
  `@("a", "b" + $c, "d")` parses as `(("a","b") + $c), "d"`: the intended one string becomes TWO
  elements, and a fixture writer emits a silently split line (bit the arc-2 ini corpus builder,
  2026-07-25; minimal repro same day). Parenthesize `("b" + $c)` or interpolate `"b$c"`.
  *Look FIRST:* any `.ps1` building a line list with `+` inside `@( )`.
  `memory/lesson_ps_comma_binds_tighter_than_plus_in_array_literals.md`
- **An aborted batch-edit script has ALREADY mutated the tree; its re-run's "0 changes" lies** — a
  mid-walk crash (non-utf8 third_party header) left the arc-3 C3a sweep FULLY applied while the
  hardened re-run printed `files: 0`, reading as "never ran" (2026-07-25). The runner's counters
  describe THE RUN, not the tree. Exclude vendored dirs up front; verify by residual-grep of the OLD
  pattern + opening one known site; treat "0 changes" after an aborted run as suspicious.
  *Look FIRST:* any os.walk/-Recurse mutator over src/ — its dir-exclusion list, then `git diff --stat`.
  `memory/lesson_aborted_batch_edit_already_mutated_verify_by_site.md`
- **`deploy-all.ps1` deploys Release** → ALWAYS build Release + hash-verify. `memory/lesson_deploy_sources_release_config_not_relwithdebinfo.md`
- **Filtered tool output HIDES verdicts — twice-bitten:** s22 a grep+tail filter ate a LINK error (a
  STALE DLL deployed; the SHA-256 build-vs-deployed compare caught it), s23 `smoke | tail -4` cut the
  `--- VERDICT ---` line on a run that was genuinely ABNORMAL (host log restarted, no verdict printed)
  — the truncation masked an invalid run. Verdict-bearing commands pipe wide (`tail -40`+) or
  unfiltered; a MISSING expected verdict/marker = INVALID RUN (rerun), never "probably fine".
  `memory/lesson_filtered_tool_output_hides_verdicts.md`
- **A "pure refactor" claim becomes a MEASUREMENT via the three-commit shape: dedups first, then a
  FROZEN standalone instrument (dev TU over public APIs — the refactor commit physically can't touch
  it) + digest BASELINE x2 on the UNSPLIT code, then the move + same scenario → digests byte-equal
  cross-peer AND cross-commit** (+ literal git-diff of moved bodies, symbol-level negative grep, a
  reconnect cycle for the connect/prime/teardown surface). Digest = content-only (proven
  eid-independent). Born: the rack extraction `73dc9ba1` (2026-07-18); executed again for
  session_streams `06921557` + the net_pump decomposition `de249463` (both 2026-07-18/19) with the
  NONDETERMINISTIC-surface variant: live streams admit no content digest, so the package = literal
  stripped-line body diff (known-positive script) + a MUTANT-PROVEN live matrix (a routeSlot/peerSlot
  swap FAILED the 4-peer cross-peer verdict; a 2-peer smoke structurally cannot see relay routing) +
  the adjacent frozen digest; for a mega-FUNCTION decomposition add the bool-return early-return
  preservation + shared-local/atomic observation-point enumeration + the caller-sweep single-token
  verifier. RENAME-vs-DISSOLVE variant (s26 autotest `f299107c`+`cc4c93c3`): a fused mv+strip lands
  under git's 50% rename-similarity threshold (grab residual ~41%) → `--follow` history silently
  severed; extract FIRST (same filename shrinks in place), then a PURE `git mv` as its own commit
  (99-100% detected) — verify with `git log --follow` before calling it done.
  SPAN-EDGE variant (s27 vitals, audit-caught `de304643`): a per-TU scaffold span can drag NEIGHBOR
  comment lines across a function boundary, and the instrument's permissive "//"-prefix allowance is
  BLIND to it — verify comment-block ownership at every span edge; the closing audit covers that
  blind spot.
  INSTRUMENT-BLIND-SPOT variant (s28 puppet `ca12e11d`, mutate-caught): a scaffold WHITELIST catches
  ADDED lines but is structurally blind to DROPPED lines — the m6 deletion mutate (internal.h decl
  drop) PASSED it; small seam/generated files get an EXACT-CONTENT sequence compare, and the mutate
  battery includes a DELETION mutate per checked file (the mutates test the INSTRUMENT, not just the
  cut). Also: span header-census greps must cover UNQUALIFIED name forms (`Call(` vs `call::` — the
  qualified-only pattern shipped a missing include the build caught).
  *Look FIRST:* `votv-s27-three-cuts-DESIGN-2026-07-19.md`; `votv-rack-extraction-DESIGN-2026-07-18.md` §4-5+§8;

  **THE TIMING HALF (2026-07-22): equivalence proves "after == before", NEVER "before was correct."**
  The whole recipe is silent on whether the behaviour was worth preserving — and that silence is
  dangerous precisely because the instruments come back GREEN. Measured: `container_contents_sync.cpp`
  at 853 LOC (soft cap 800) looked like ideal no-PC extraction work, but its arbitration compares the
  hash of the WHOLE container, and the already-approved fix for that rewrites `HostAcceptsClientWrite`,
  `g_publishedHash`, `g_baseHash` and the blob format together. Extracting first would freeze an interim
  shape and rewrite the new file wholesale a step later, while a byte-equal body-diff certified the move
  as faithful — faithful to a shape about to die. **Rule:** before extracting, check whether an OPEN
  measurement or an approved change targets the code being moved; if so the extraction WAITS. Over the
  soft cap is an audit flag, not a blocker (soft 800, hard 1500). *Look FIRST:* the open-thread ledger's
  gate column — if a still-open row names the code you are moving, the shape is provisional.

- **A canonical helper FUSES failure modes its callers may be branching on — so consolidating a
  hand-rolled duplicate onto it is a behaviour change, not a cleanup** (2026-08-26). `[V]`
  `element::LiveActorOfType` (`registry.cpp:300-307`) returns `nullptr` for FOUR distinct reasons: eid 0,
  no Registry row, wrong `ElementType`, or a failed `IsLiveByIndex`. `[V]`
  `trash_grab_intent.cpp:167-170` hand-rolls the same four-step walk and was on the record as a lazy
  duplicate to migrate onto it — but it is not one. It keeps `pe` and `pa` as separate live values and the
  lane branches THREE ways with OPPOSITE remedies: absent row, or a row whose actor is stale-dead → this
  eid is a ghost, broadcast its destroy so every peer drains the row (and the log prints which of the two,
  `row=%s actor=%p`); **a LIVE actor of the wrong class → heal instead, and `:194` says why in so many
  words — *"the identity names a real entity, so NEVER destroy on a class mismatch."*** Consolidating onto
  the canonical helper folds wrong-TYPE into the same `nullptr` as absent-row, moving every live non-Prop
  element out of the heal branch and into the destroy branch: a one-line "cleanup" that inverts a
  documented invariant. Two things generalise. **Fusing is invisible in the diff being written and visible
  only in an `else` twenty lines below it** — the diff shows three lines becoming one, while the regression
  lives in a branch that no longer means what it meant. And **a safety property does not transfer with a
  helper**: `LiveActorOfType`'s header calls its type argument "the fail-closed half", which is right for
  its 21 callers, yet in THIS lane resolving a wrong-class actor is exactly what keeps a real entity alive.
  *Look FIRST:* before consolidating, ask what the helper's failure value FUSES, then read every branch the
  caller takes on it; if the caller distinguishes two of the fused causes, the helper's RETURN TYPE is the
  blocker, not the call site. And re-check the migration list itself — this one said "two call sites" and
  `[V]` one of them (`prop_drop_intent.cpp:370-386`) resolves no eid at all (it takes a key, a class and a
  point, then spawns), so it could never have been migrated onto an eid resolver and the count had never
  been checked after being written.
  **THE FIX SHIPPED 2026-08-26 (`7de9228c`)**: `coop/element/intent_authority` returns an
  outcome-carrying result instead of a pointer, so the caller branches on WHY the resolve failed
  (and gets the actor back on a type mismatch, which the heal branch consumes). The canonical
  helper is unchanged and still right for the ~19 host-authored sites.

  the WRONG FIELD with zero signals; a fresh-world smoke doesn't discriminate it either — zeros both
  ways). Root fix = kill the class before extracting: self-binding `{L"name", &g_offVar}` rows + named
  derefs in their OWN verified commit (`f74d05dc`), correspondence script w/ --mutate known-positive

  changes** — set the var in the invoking shell (mp.py copies `os.environ` at launch, mp.py:425; the
  SpawnIf gates live in `harness/autotest/autotest_dispatch.cpp` — helper :22-29 + the
  SpawnEnvGatedTests table; scenarios self-gate by role).
  Gate discipline: import the shipped verifier's LITERAL patterns verbatim (lan-test.ps1 weather verdict
  :440-449), run the gate on a BASELINE run first (pattern counting 0 on baseline = broken instrument),
  min-count FLOORS on periodic diag lines (caught a parallel-audit-shrunk 90s window as 29<30 in s25),
  compare WITHIN-RUN convergence never cross-run absolutes (organic RNG differs; peers move together).
  COMBINING scenarios in one run needs a ONE-WRITER-PER-AXIS census (s26): two scenarios writing the
  same game-state axis (grab+clump on the host held-item; clump+clumpvis on the garbage-clump wire
  lane) give nondeterministic verdicts NOT absorbed by baseline-first — split them across runs; the
  s26 dissolve exercised all 10 routines via two pairs, 36 verdict keys identical.

  extraction/placement axis. Born s25: `ue_wrap/world/daynightcycle.{h,cpp}` (the cycle's CLOCK half)
  existed through a 7-round /qf whose axis argument asserted its absence; the decision survived only

  none) — all services green on-box, ALL dead from the internet; and dual-stack `curl ifconfig.me`
  answered v6 → the master handed unbracketed-IPv6 URIs (`curl -4` fix, `d56a4f69`). *Look FIRST:*

- **Endpoint move: enumerate EVERY config layer — a key ABSENT from an ini silently rides the COMPILED
  default.** 2026-07-16 VPS cutover: HOST's ini had no `[net]` block, CLIENT_3 no ini at all — a
  value-grep found only CLIENT_1/2 and would have left half the installs on the dead box. Also: a
  duplicated default literal with a "keep in sync" comment = drift bomb — alias the ONE definition
  (`cd6faf81`). *Look FIRST:* grep the OLD value repo-wide AND check each install for key-ABSENCE;
  flip `protocol.h` constants in the same change. **Sharpened 2026-07-20 (Tier B arc 1): THE REMOTE
  SERVICE'S OWN ENV IS A CONFIG LAYER.** The s29d sweep still left the master's `COOP_SIGNALING_URL`
  a bare IP, and that value is handed to every client and **overrides** their configured signaling
  URL — so the compiled hostname only served the master-down path while real sessions dialled the IP
  (which can never pass TLS hostname validation). If a field arrives in a response, the *sender's*
  config is one of your layers. `memory/lesson_endpoint_move_enumerate_config_layers.md`
- **A green `certbot renew --dry-run` proves NOTHING about the renewal landing — it skips deploy
  hooks; and `LoadCredential=` is a START-TIME SNAPSHOT.** 2026-07-20: the first dry-run said "all
  simulated renewals succeeded" while the hook never ran (no syslog line, `ActiveEnterTimestamp`
  unmoved); `--run-deploy-hooks` moved it 10:05:10→10:19:43 with all 4 listeners back. Sandboxed
  (`DynamicUser`+`ProtectSystem=strict`) services get the cert copied into `/run/credentials/` at
  START, so a renewed file on disk never reaches a running process without a restart. *Look FIRST:*
  `tools/cert_check.py` — the alarm lives OFF the box and reads the cert the listener actually
  SERVES, which proves renewal+hook+restart+snapshot in one handshake (an on-box log reproduces the
  very blindness it guards). `memory/lesson_certbot_dry_run_skips_deploy_hooks.md`
- **CF-PROXIED root passes only HTTP(S) — custom-port services need the GREY-CLOUD subdomain; an
  IP→hostname flip needs a per-consumer RESOLVER check first.** 2026-07-19 s29d: root `multivoid.dev`
  resolves to Cloudflare proxy IPs (web works, master :10001/:10443 / signaling :10000/:10442 / STUN :3478 would be
  dead — "half-alive" failure); the constants use `master.multivoid.dev` (grey cloud → the box). Flip
  was safe only because both consumers resolve natively (WinHttpConnect http_client.cpp:81; getaddrinfo
  signaling_client.cpp:234) — an `inet_pton`-only consumer would silently fail on a hostname. *Look

- **Pre-push leak audit (PUBLIC repo) catches ASSOCIATION leaks, not just secrets; a commit REBUILD
  danglees every doc'd SHA.** 2026-07-16 s13b: the migration commits leaked zero credentials but tied
  both VPS IPs to the other tenants' service names — for a proxy stack that IS the payload; scrubbed +
  commits rebuilt (`d56a4f69`/`cd6faf81`/`c653a538`), which dangled 9 already-written SHA refs across
  docs+memory. *Look FIRST:* `gh repo view --json isPrivate`; grep the diff for service names/hostnames
  near IPs (a leftover hit is OK only as a REMOVAL line: `grep -vE '^[0-9]+:-'` on the hits = empty);
  after any rewrite grep the OLD SHAs across docs/ research/ memory/.
  **HEAD 3 (2026-08-26): a TIP scrub does not UN-publish, and the split belongs at WRITE time.** The audit
  failed on a different axis -- three rows in a public ledger reasoned about still-open weaknesses and
  pointed into a local register -- and the fix was applied to the tip, then pushed. In general that is
  wrong: the offending blobs live in the intermediate commits and the push publishes them whatever the tip
  says. (What genuinely differed: a PARALLEL session was committing into the same tree, so a 30-commit
  rebuild risked clobbering its work -- a real reason to prefer the tip fix, and one to state plainly to
  the user, including that the rebuild offer stands.) The durable rule: **decide the public/local split in
  the SAME EDIT that writes the row** -- a row written out of security work is not "public by default,
  audited later", because the audit at the push gate can only ever be a tip fix. Three rows written across
  three sessions all failed, and each would have cost one minute at write time.

  **Idle death claims BOTH peers — ROOT = STARVATION, now keepalive-fixed** (2026-07-10 night: harness

  (client ~18 min, HOST ~80 min — the 14:27:16 "LOCAL PLAYER DIED
  role=HOST" real log): a later "connect timed out" against such a host is CORRECT, not a join bug (the
  2026-07-10 "stale-slot race" candidate was exactly this, refuted from the saved logs). Long exposure

- **Making a static/absent MIRROR MOVE can WAKE dormant per-peer OUTPUT generation** (2026-07-15, desk
  cursor v109). The jaggy-cursor fix animated the host's coords-panel cursor mirror; the host's native BP
  then began appending LOCAL `MOVE_*` coordLog lines from that motion (silent while the mirror was frozen),
  and `ProduceLogLines` running on "EVERY peer" shipped them → host shipped 78 log lines vs client 13 = a
  NEW divergence the fix created. You test the axis you fixed (cursor = smooth) and miss the downstream axis
  the motion now DRIVES (the log). Rule: after animating any mirror, enumerate every per-peer producer that
  reads the now-moving field (log producers, tick-sims, ship counters) and gate it to the owner / suppress
  the non-owner path. A "mirror the input" change is incomplete until "don't ALSO generate the output
  locally" is done. **2nd instance (v115b `de31889e`): the wake needs NO animation — ONE wire-applied

- **A seeded config value OVERRIDES the code default — a "documentation" seeder is a drift bomb.**
  `ReadIniValue` returns `def` only when the key is **ABSENT** (`config.cpp:96-104`), so writing
  `key=value` into a user's ini pins that value for that install forever. Proof it is not theoretical: a
  hand-written ten-line sketch got **4 of 10 defaults wrong** (port 7777 vs 47621, ui.scale 1.0 vs 1.25,
  net.master empty vs its `DEFAULT` sentinel, one font key vs five roles). Config files carry user
  STATE; a catalog of defaults belongs in a generated `*.example` that is never read as config, emitted
  commented. **And the bomb was already assembled (2026-07-24):** `release/votv-coop.ini` sat in the repo
  carrying `Pelmentor` / `net.master=DEFAULT` / `net.port=47621` as ACTIVE values — nothing deployed it,
  no `RELEASE.md` line mentioned it, untouched since 2026-06-23 (pre-rebrand name). An artifact nothing
  references does not become harmless, it becomes *unmaintained while still readable*; on a public repo
  that is worse. Deleted by user ruling (RULE 2). *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_seeded_config_value_overrides_the_code_default.md`
- **"First match wins" is a property of the READER, not of the file format.** `multivoid.ini` has two
  readers with two different rules: `ReadIniValue` breaks on the first matching **KEY** whatever its value
  (`config.cpp:96-104`), `LookupTriState` on the first **RECOGNIZED VALUE**, skipping `key=garbage` above
  `key=1` (`:457-473`) — plus opposite case-sensitivity, opposite comment handling, and no mutex (so the
  file's own "Readers take it too" comment is FALSE). A design doc had stated the rule once, for "the
  file", and three separate decisions leaned on it — including "insertion is a MOVE, never an ADD", which
  is **not** behaviour-preserving: moving one occurrence past another inverts a flag verdict. Count the
  readers before writing any "how the file is read" fact; collapse duplicates BEFORE reordering.
  **RESOLVED (pass 3, 2026-07-25, converged):** occurrence selection was UNIFIED — authoritative line =
  first case-insensitive KEY occurrence, one rule for reader/writer/report; layers differ only in value
  vocabulary; first-RECOGNIZED retired. Safety measured (zero ci collisions across all 109 keys). Bonus
  find: today's case-sensitive writer can make the two readers disagree with ONE write (`Enabled=1` +
  write `enabled` → EOF duplicate). *Look
  FIRST:* `memory/lesson_first_match_is_a_reader_property_not_a_format_property.md`
- **When N incompatible readers already ship, no unification preserves them all — CHOOSE, then
  ENUMERATE.** Four truthiness readers coexist in `multivoid.ini` (`1|true|0|false` whole-line; `!= "0"`
  where *anything* is true; `== "1"` strict where `true` reads FALSE; a 4-token chain), so
  `nameplate=true` works today and `ui.netstats=true` silently does not. Two `/qf` rounds were burned
  engineering a preserving vocabulary (narrow → breaks `net.master.custom=yes`; union → the `!= "0"`
  readers accept every string, so any shared vocabulary narrows them). Write *"no behaviour-preserving
  option exists"* down first, choose on merits (obey what the user literally wrote), enumerate every
  moved verdict — then check each against "does the new reading match what they wrote?". That check
  **dissolved an entire subsystem** here (a meaning-change report, its persisted state, its deferral, four
  legacy predicates): a mechanism that exists only to apologize for a change usually means the change was
  described wrong. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_choose_and_enumerate_when_no_behaviour_preserving_option_exists.md`
- **Never host a report about X behind a gate that X controls.** The config-review panel for
  `multivoid.ini` was placed in `dev_menu`, which is gated on `MasterEnabled() && devkeys` (post-arc-3: `ResolveFlag(rows::devkeys)`)
  (`dev_menu.cpp:539`) — i.e. the user must hand-edit the very file he is asking for help with. The two
  other candidates failed the same test differently: `multivoid.log` has **no owner-reader** ("reported"
  with no reader is a fiction), and the loader's boot dialog is a different severity whose `Arm` is
  single-slot (a second message silently drops the first, `boot_warning_dialog.cpp:29-35`). Before picking
  a surface, ask what turns it ON and whether the audience already looks there. **Second instance one gate
  DEEPER (2026-07-25):** the multiplayer menu itself is ini-gated (`multiplayer_menu_off`,
  `multiplayer_menu.cpp:310`); the surface that survived measurement is the HUD root (`imgui_overlay` +
  `hud` — zero ini reads, boot-installed `harness.cpp:469`). Grep the candidate's RENDER PATH for gates,
  not just its label. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_diagnostic_surface_gated_by_what_it_diagnoses.md`
- **ABSENT/UNREADABLE conflation makes every mint-then-persist path destructive.** `ReadIniValue`
  returns its default for BOTH "key absent" and "file unreadable" (`config.cpp:96-104`), and the guid
  mint (`:407-434`) persists immediately on default — so a transient lock releasing between the failed
  read and the write lets the fresh guid **overwrite the user's stored identity** (skin `:390-405` is
  byte-identical; `:431` logs "persisted" unconditionally though the writer is `void` and aborts on
  locks). Deeper: `fgets` NULL conflates EOF with stream error and the loops never check `ferror`
  (`:99-102`) — a mid-stream failure verdicts every later key as authoritative-ABSENT. Fix shape: a
  tri-state read (`value/ABSENT/UNREADABLE`, authority only on clean EOF; errno discriminates —
  measured: locked=`EACCES` vs missing=`ENOENT`), mint gated on authoritative ABSENT, writer returns
  `bool`. *Look FIRST:* `memory/lesson_absent_unreadable_conflation_makes_mint_paths_destructive.md`
- **One file format, ONE parse primitive.** `multivoid.ini` is parsed by three different fixed buffers —
  `char[128]` (`LookupTriState`), `char[256]` (reader), `char[512]` (writer) — and a 380-char line
  already mints a **live phantom key in 2 of 4 real inis** (fgets splits it, the tail contains `=`). The
  reader's split is ephemeral; the **writer's would be persisted**, i.e. the 2026-07-02 data-loss class.
  Raising the number moves the wall; use an unbounded read, and for a local file the user owns, log an
  over-long line — never drop it. *Look FIRST:*
  `memory/lesson_one_file_format_needs_one_parse_primitive.md`

- **A Windows text-mode writer defeats any byte compare-first; a both-outcomes-tolerant assert
  cannot see the dead branch.** `AtomicWriteLines` opened `L"w"` — the CRT translated every `\n` to
  CRLF on disk, so the T8 catalog's `existing == fresh` (binary read vs LF-built string) was
  PERMANENTLY false: the "identical→skip" branch was dead, every boot logged "regenerated" — and the
  drill stayed green because its assert accepted BOTH `Regenerated|UpToDate`. Fix `42fabf77` (writer
  → `wb`); revival proven by TWO consecutive boots (run 2 logs "up-to-date"). Check BOTH fopen modes
  of any write/read byte-compare pair; give every compare branch a scenario that forces it. *Look
  FIRST:* `memory/lesson_text_mode_write_defeats_byte_compare.md`
- **Editing `build-core.yml` = do the fingerprint re-commit ritual in the SAME workstream.** The
  release judge pins `build_core_sha256`; the b127-dev run refused pre-build (`FINGERPRINT: FAIL`,
  run 30168572721) because `ad15ae7c` added the registry-gate step without re-smoking. The refusal
  is designed — but the recovery (cacheless build ~40 min + local smoke of the CI bytes + commit
  `fingerprint-dump.json` + re-run) costs ~1.5 h AT RELEASE TIME. Dispatch the cacheless build right
  after the build-core edit lands, not when the judge refuses. **CRLF addendum (2026-07-26):** the
  hash is the RUNNER'S autocrlf (CRLF) view — a local LF checkout hashes differently by design;
  LF→CRLF conversion reproduces the dump byte-exact. Commit the run's dump VERBATIM, never a
  locally-computed hash. *Look FIRST:*

  the fear "GNS under me will drop" is measured false. **UPDATED 2026-08-24:** the pause shipped
  CLIENT-ONLY, so the host re-created the very loss this row says GNS never inflicts, one layer up in
  our own code -- fixed in `5dd21bb6`, and the one-sided application is its own lesson
  (`memory/lesson_a_protection_added_to_one_role_only.md`). *Look FIRST:* session.cpp NetThread drain

- **THE LAB RUNS THE JOIN 25x FASTER THAN THE FIELD, BY CONSTRUCTION — so any DURATION-sensitive join
  defect is structurally invisible to every LAN smoke.** `[V]` 2026-09-02: the effective GNS send rate
  is `clamp(ping-at-init estimate, Min, Max)` and this build has NO bandwidth estimation — no loss-,
  ack- or timer-driven writer exists (`session_status.cpp:72-79`, vendored `snp.cpp` "FIXME — we might
  implement BBR probe cycle"). So ANY internet ping (> ~4.4 ms) pins the link at `SendRateMin` = **1
  MB/s forever**, while sub-ms LAN gets `SendRateMax` = **25 MB/s**. A 17.6 MB world transfer is
  therefore **<1 s in the lab and 17+ s in the field**, and the field host's net-diag reads
  `sendRate=1048576B/s` to the byte. The consequence is not slowness, it is BLINDNESS: the lab cannot
  reproduce a defect whose mechanism is *how long a human stares at a screen*, and no autonomous drill
  ever gives up. Two field joiners quit at +2 s and +3 s of a working 17 s download on 2026-09-02;
  every lab smoke of that path had passed. **Look here FIRST:** before concluding "the lab covers it",
  ask what the lab's WALL-CLOCK is for the same work — `net.sendrate_kbs` /
  `VOTVCOOP_NET_SENDRATE_KBS` pins the rate and has been drilled at 256 KB/s, so the slow window IS
  reproducible on demand; it simply is not the default. [[lesson-the-lab-runs-the-join-25x-faster-than-the-field]]

- **A library's DEFAULT is not your binary's effective config — census your own init path for
  overrides before recording a "default" as a fact** (SendRate pass, 2026-08-23): R-4b measured GNS
  stock `SendRateMin/Max = 256 KB/s` (`csteamnetworkingsockets.cpp:84-85`) and recorded it as the
  shipped behavior + filed a "raise it?" product question — but `session_start.cpp:79-84` had
  overridden BOTH globally (1/25 MB/s) since 2026-06-06, and the June memory recorded that raise.
  One false fact contaminated 7 prose sites before a critic forced the measurement. DETECTION
  instrument (the positive check, not just the caution): read the effective value your OWN
  telemetry logs — net-diag's `sendRate=` field showed exactly 1048576 in 180/180 field samples;
  a "default" claim that contradicts your own logged effective value is wrong by artifact. Also
  grep init paths for `SetGlobalConfigValue|SetConnectionConfigValue` (or the library's setter
  vocabulary) before asserting any library default. *Look FIRST:*

- **A fan-out bool that conflates "refused" with "no audience" turns retry into a DUP generator**
  (seeds arc commit-0, 2026-08-23): `SendReliable` returns `anySuccess` = FALSE with ZERO
  world-ready receivers (session.cpp:241-250) -- indistinguishable from a real refusal -- so the
  lanes' retry-until-sent idiom re-broadcast solo-authored rows to the first joiner, whose SAVE
  already contained them: duplicate emails/signals, LIVE since v64 (audit-I-1's deliberate
  hold-and-retry). Once a lane's absentee coverage is save+seed, a zero-audience refusal is a
  VACUOUS SUCCESS (adopt sent=true, `!AnyWorldReadyPeer()`); ~15 other lanes consume the ambiguous
  bool -- censused + FILED, never flip one without its own seed (dup <-> loss trade). The /qf
  critic's "READ the return path before building" overturned three rounds of confident inference.

  arc, 2026-08-23): MarkSlotWorldReady flips inside the ClientWorldReady GT drain case
  (event_feed.cpp:230) while the host relay checks it at NET receive (session_relay.cpp:86) -- a
  reliable received in [announce net-receipt, GT flip] was relay-skipped AND applied after the
  seed's cur-read (queued behind the announce, FIFO): lost on both legs. Meadow carried this
  micro-window from v120 unnoticed. Fix shape: a NET-thread view of the same event -- the
  hConn-stamped `relayEligible_` set at receipt AFTER inbox accept, cleared beside every
  FreeSlot; recycled-slot inheritance structurally impossible. *Look FIRST:* any per-slot gate

- **Engine-resolved is NOT lane-settled -- anchor deferred applies on the lane's own predicate**
  (seeds-arc audit F-2/F-3/F-4, 2026-08-23): after a world travel `EnsureResolved()` succeeds
  while the array is still ASYNCHRONOUSLY FILLING (email's own 2026-06-19 prime-stabilize
  discovery), so the new apply park draining on bare resolve re-opened the clobber window one
  level down. Folds: drain gates on `g_primed` (count-stability); unsettled arrivals park too;
  stuck-front retries pace at 1 Hz REAL time (30 per-frame retries burned in ~0.4 s); tombstone
  expiry pauses while the park is non-empty. The trap: the lane ALREADY owned the settle
  machinery -- reuse it, never parallel it with a weaker generic predicate. *Look FIRST:*

- **A wall-clock TTL on a park that waits for data from a DIFFERENT lane is a silent drop one level
  up** (R-4b round 4): ContainerContents rides Normal, its PropSpawn rides Bulk -- lanes deliver
  independently, so under backpressure the contents SYSTEMATICALLY arrive first, and once delivery is
  guaranteed a slow link holds the Bulk stream past ANY fixed TTL with zero wire loss (282 expired
  parks in the field). Fix shape (D9, built): anchor aging to the EVENT that proves
  arrival-or-orphanhood (SnapshotComplete is lane-ordered after every spawn it brackets); the TTL
  survives as a leak-guard only. Ask this of every fixed-TTL park whose feed rides another channel.

- **A public hostname is not a public origin IP — know which one you are redacting.** The service
  hostname is compiled into a DLL we distribute (`protocol.h:1113`), so hiding it is theatre; the ORIGIN
  IP behind the root domain's Cloudflare proxying is a different asset, and publishing it in four tracked
  docs defeated that proxying outright (origin bypass) plus named the host. Ask *which of the two* and
  *from whom* before redacting. Also: "not a secret" and "fine to publish" are different judgements —
  casual discoverability is a real axis; say which one you are buying. `docs/security/TRACKER.md` **A11**,
  `b2c4b3ef`. **RECURRED 2026-08-23:** the same address was still public for another month in
  `research/` — a committed raw session log (four lines: stun / turn / signaling resolve / P2P listen)
  and a findings doc — because the A11 sweep was scoped to `docs/`. Fixed by unpublishing the corpus
  (`cf3780d2`), not by a fourth grep; the durable form is the leak-sweep-scope row above.

- **A rule an agent wrote comes back cited as the user's rule — check provenance before obeying it.**
  "`tools/mp.py` is NEVER committed" was quoted as policy by `MEMORY.md`, by `tools/net/departure_drill.ps1`'s
  header and by my own `/qf` brief. Measured: the sentence entered `docs/OPUS_48_DISCIPLINE.md` in that
  doc's **own authoring commit** `1e3c81f5`, **author Claude, 2026-07-06**; no user utterance created it;
  `git check-ignore` matches nothing; and mp.py had been committed **8 times** (2026-06-15 .. `c1403fd7`)
  before the rule existed. The cost: `HEAD:tools/mp.py` is 2,532 lines with **zero** `selftest`, while
  `docs/RELEASE.md` step 0 names two machine assertions produced only by an uncommitted working tree —
  **the release gate has not been runnable from a clean clone since 2026-07-02**, and every session read
  the ritual as intact. It survived because it was *plausible* and because it shared a sentence with
  `"kerfur skins icons/"`, which has a REAL justification (copyrighted art) — the true half lent
  credibility to the invented half. *Look FIRST:* run `git log -S"<the sentence>"` before obeying a rule
  that constrains the repo; a prose rule nothing enforces is not a rule (put it in `.gitignore`/CI with
  the why, or label it a preference); tag "the user's rule" in a `/qf` brief as the provenance CLAIM it
  is; and fix a false attribution IMMEDIATELY — that is factual and yours — while the ruling on the
  rule's content stays the user's. **SECOND INSTANCE 2026-07-29, and this one constrained BEHAVIOUR:**
  `imgui_overlay.cpp:210-213` claims ESC-falls-through-to-the-pause-menu is *"the user-requested 'ESC =
  chat gone, user lands in the menu' behavior"*, and it was about to outrank the user's own *"close like
  minecraft"* in a live design decision. `git log -S"user lands in the menu"` returns ONE commit —
  `f32ed1b0`, a 250+-file backlog flush of sessions 11-16 — whose message records no such request.
  Asked in plain text, the user chose Minecraft-shaped, which made a CRITICAL defect **dissolve** rather
  than need a workaround. **The check is now two instances and one command: any comment saying "the user
  requested" that is about to DECIDE something gets `git log -S` first.**

- **2026-08-24 — A PUBLIC DOC THAT GIVES COORDINATES INTO REMOVED-BUT-HISTORICAL CONTENT *IS* THE
  LEAK.** Unpublishing a directory removes it from the TIP, not from history — and that was a
  considered decision. `[V]` What was not considered: a row in the arc doc's findings table -- then a tracked public file --
  named the exact path AND line range of a committed crash log, plus the four log lines it held, as
  *evidence that the origin VPS IP had leaked*. The value was in **zero** tracked files; the MAP was
  published. Two trivial steps, and the second is only findable because the first was printed. **Axis 2
  of the pre-push audit — the secrets grep — passed clean**, as it always does in this failure mode.
  The sentence was written BY the remediation (a precise citation is a better record — and a better
  treasure map), and it survived a full docs audit whose rule was about *citation bleed*, i.e. aimed
  one category away: that rule polices sentences about FINDINGS, this was a sentence about a FILE.
  *Look FIRST:* after unpublishing anything, **grep the still-public tree for coordinates INTO it** —
  `git grep -nE "<removed-prefix>[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+[:0-9-]*[0-9]"` over tracked docs; removing a
  container while keeping its index is not removing it. **Distinguish "reachable" from "advertised"
  when you write the decision down** — "history is not rewritten" reads as risk-accepted-and-closed,
  and it accepted reachability, not advertising. Name the CLASS, withhold the coordinates, say you are
  withholding them. And prefer unpublishing the CONTAINER to patching the row.

- **2026-08-24 — MOVING A SECTION OUT OF A FILE THAT AGENTS ARE *INSTRUCTED* TO READ silently costs
  them that corpus, and a tidy stub is worse than a broken link.** Section 9 of this very file was
  split out to a local-only path; every referential check passed (no dangling public link, new file on
  disk, honest stub). `[V]` But the `/qf` critic prompt tells its agent *"read docs/LESSONS.md ... it
  is your PRIOR-ART index"* — so every future critic would open this file, find prose where §9 was, and
  move on, losing the peer-identity / trust-boundary / receive-boundary / authority-signature rows.
  **The user caught it, not me.** What I had checked was REFERENTIAL integrity (does every pointer
  resolve); what I had not checked was INSTRUCTIONAL integrity (is anything told to read this file, and
  does that instruction still get what it came for). A broken link announces itself; a well-written
  stub reads like a complete short section, so the tidier it is the quieter the loss — and a critic
  that never saw the corpus just asks slightly worse questions forever, with no signal anywhere.
  *Look FIRST:* before moving a section out, **grep who is INSTRUCTED to read the file** (skills,
  agent prompts, CLAUDE.md's reading order) and ask what each reader came for. Fix it in BOTH places —
  an agent-addressed directive in the stub AND the instruction itself naming both files. Note the
  knock-on: this ledger's 1:1 `memory/` pairing now SPANS two files, so a pairing check that greps one
  reports false violations. `memory/feedback_moving_a_section_out_of_an_agent_read_file.md`

**A shared working tree means ONE git index, so `git add` is a cross-session side effect.** Two sessions on this box; my ten explicitly-named staged paths were swallowed by the other session's `git commit` (no pathspec) in the ~40 s while I wrote my message -- ~700 lines of browser work recorded under an ATV commit. `MEMORY.md`'s "explicit paths, NEVER add -A/-u" was obeyed and did not help: the hazard is not your pathspec, it is that the index is shared at all. **Look here FIRST:** skip the index -- `git commit -F - -- <paths>` commits the working-tree version of exactly those paths and leaves everyone else's index entries alone. If a commit's `--stat` lists files you never touched, suspect this before your own pathspec. A NEW file is the form's boundary: a pathspec commit takes only TRACKED files, so `git add` exactly that one path first, then pathspec-commit — add-then-BARE-commit is the swallowing form (verified 2026-08-30, `a28727fa`: 4 paths committed, the neighbour session's dirty files untouched). **AND A SECOND BOUNDARY, measured 2026-08-31 (`0a968e6c`) by writing the opposite into a commit message and being contradicted one command later: a pathspec commit is index-neutral for OTHER paths, NOT for the paths it NAMES.** The shared index held a stale blob of `docs/LESSONS.md` from a parallel lane; I pathspec-committed that file, stated in the message that I had deliberately not touched the staged entry, and `git diff --cached` then showed the staged set had gone **15 -> 14** with that entry now equal to HEAD. The staged content for a named path is REPLACED by what you commit (recoverable — the blob survives in the object store). So the form protects a neighbour's *files*, not a neighbour's *staging of a file you are also committing*. **The tell you are in that case: `git diff --cached --stat -- <file>` is non-empty for a file you are about to pathspec-commit** — then take the UNION into the worktree and commit that, or leave the file alone. **AND THE MORE EXPENSIVE HALF, from fixing that very misstatement: `--amend` HAS NO PATHSPEC.** To correct the sentence I ran `git commit --amend` bare — a bare amend takes the WHOLE INDEX and inherits every hazard the pathspec form exists to avoid — and this index held **STALE entries, blobs OLDER than HEAD**, for fourteen files a parallel lane had staged and since committed past. The amend therefore committed a **REVERT: 1,088 deletions** (`death_revive.cpp` 755→664, `DEATH_ARC.md` −84, `sdk_profile.h` −42, `session_runtime.cpp` −14, +10 more). Repaired by `git reset --mixed <good sha>` + a pathspec re-commit; nothing lost, nothing pushed, and what made it recoverable is that the WORKTREE was never touched (`git diff <good sha> --stat` over all fourteen paths: empty — that both proved the damage and proved it was only in the commit). **The reframe: a staged entry is not automatically someone's live WIP.** I tiptoed around those 14 for an hour believing they were; they were dead leftovers pointing at older versions of already-committed files — i.e. a revert waiting for any bare commit to fire it, and *more* dangerous than fresh work because its damage shows up as deletions in files you never opened. So: **`git diff --cached --stat` before ANY commit, not only a risky one** — empty is the only state in which a bare `git commit`/`--amend` is safe on a shared tree — and treat `--amend` as the bare commit it is (if the original used a pathspec, reset and redo rather than amend). Corollary from the same run: read the diff DIRECTION before acting on it (`--cached` is HEAD→index, plain `git diff` is index→worktree; I read them inverted, concluded the WORKTREE had been clobbered when it was the INDEX holding the stale side, and briefly rebuilt the file from the wrong source — an assertion in my own throwaway script printed "union has the correction: False" and caught it). **AND THE PRIVATE-INDEX WORKAROUND MAKES IT WORSE OVER TIME (2026-08-31).** Committing through a private `GIT_INDEX_FILE` protects the neighbour but never touches the shared index, so it DRIFTS FURTHER with every use. By one session's end it held `13 files changed, 21 insertions(+), **1219 deletions(-)**` — a complete reversion of everything that session built, with two NEW modules staged as DELETED while they existed both on disk and in HEAD. A plain `git commit` would have undone the lot. Nothing failed; a post-ship audit found it by reading `git status`. **The tell is a tracked, on-disk file reported as `D`**, and `git ls-files -s <path>` returning nothing for a file HEAD contains. Fix: `git reset` — index only, worktree untouched. So the `git diff --cached --stat` habit above is owed not only before a commit but **after every private-index commit and at session end**. **AND IT RECURRED 2026-09-01, in a session that had this row indexed and had read it** -- two private-index commits left the shared index at `-950` lines with a brand-new `gc_pin.h` staged as `D`; nothing failed, `git status` simply printed `MM` on nineteen files and only looking caught it. Knowing the hazard did not prevent it, so the practice is not an end-of-session sweep (by then you have carried a loaded revert for hours, and a concurrent session could have committed over it): **bind the repair to the action** -- whatever runs `git commit` with `GIT_INDEX_FILE` set runs `git reset -q -- <the same paths>` immediately after, in the same command. [[lesson-a-shared-index-makes-git-add-a-cross-session-side-effect]]

**Extracting an operation without its INVALIDATION ships the bug twice.** I moved a row hit test into a shared kit so two screens could share it, and left the settling pass, the scroll term and the shown-row count duplicated per screen -- then fixed only one copy. The other kept a cursor-motion-only gate over a scrollable list, where the stored index chooses which WORLD to load: wheel one notch without moving the mouse, click, host the wrong save. My own commit message described the defect in full while writing it about the other file. **Look here FIRST:** when you extract an operation, list what the original call site does AROUND the call -- anything that is not that screen's own business is part of the operation. The fix shape is one object owning both (`native_screen::HoverTracker`). Same day, one layer down: a resolve latched in the reader and left unlatched in the two writers, and the latches that were added latched only SUCCESS, so their failure path was the full-array scan they removed. [[lesson-extracting-the-operation-without-its-invalidation-ships-the-bug-twice]]

**A NUL byte mid-stream flips grep into binary mode and it silently swallows the rest — so a census over `git log -p` fails toward "clean".** The pre-push audit over 226 commits reported 3x `127.0.0.1` and zero identifier hits; with `-a`, the same range holds 10 IP lines and 4 benign hits. Four NUL bytes — sitting in Markdown PROSE (pasted terminal artifacts in two doc waves), in a range where git's own `--numstat` classifies zero files as binary — flipped GNU grep at the poison point; everything matched BEFORE it still printed, so the output read as a complete, plausible census. `git log` emits newest-first: the suppressed tail is the OLDEST commits, exactly where vendor drops land. A sibling session's independent census caught the miss — and the comparison cut both ways, because a NET census (`git diff A..B`, `--name-only` included) drops added-then-deleted material that a push still publishes permanently. **Look here FIRST:** every grep stage over a git stream carries `-a`; every push census — content AND paths — runs in per-commit replay shape (`git log -p` / `git log --pretty=format: --name-only`), with `comm -23` against the net listing to prove nothing was added-then-deleted; when a zero looks too clean, count NULs first (`| tr -cd '\0' | wc -c`) or plant a known token past the suspect point. Convergence after both instruments were fixed: identical counts on every axis from two independent pipelines, and 471 replay paths == 471 net.

**A worktree build of this repo needs three non-obvious inputs.** 2026-08-30, three failed configures before the fourth built (needed because the SHARED tree was mid-edit unbuildable while an acceptance run needed known bytes): (1) a SHORT worktree path — MSBuild FileTracker dies with FTK1011 on MAX_PATH `.tlog` paths under the deep session-scratchpad dir, surfacing as a misleading late `MSB1009`; (2) the vcpkg toolchain trio, reusing the MAIN tree's already-materialized store — `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/.../vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR=<main>/build/votv-coop/vcpkg_installed -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_INSTALL=OFF` (else Protobuf is not found); (3) `--recursive` on the GameNetworkingSockets submodule (nested abseil fails `check_submodule` otherwise). Companion facts: the boot banner's compiled-stamp does NOT identify a relink (`__DATE__` lives in one banner TU — verify a binary by hash or by a BEHAVIOR only the new code emits), and `mp.py smoke --no-deploy` (`f45827a8`) is how a run keeps its provenance when the shared build slot changes hands. **Look here FIRST:** the verbatim recipe block in `memory/lesson-a-worktree-build-of-this-repo-needs-three-non-obvious-inputs.md`.

**A fork's fix is verified COMMIT BY COMMIT against your current tree, because a fork branches at a
point in time.** 2026-08-31, adopting from `archhn0madd/Multifoid` (a fork of this repo, 2 unique
commits, based 254 commits back): the first was a live root-cause fix — the boot poll's two world
reads still answered from the DYING world on our main (`engine_save.cpp:243/251` + `:372/378`), patch
applied clean. The second annotated `FatalCloseSlot`'s `peerConns_` write `GEN: clear` — and main had
already resolved that exact site as `GEN: none -- CLIENT side: slot 0 is the host LINK handle, not a
peer-slot` (`session_status.cpp:752`), with `peerconn_gate` PASS. Both were true about the snapshot
they branched from; one was still true about main. Adopting the pair wholesale would have been
SILENT — the gate passes either way, so a measured rationale would have been swapped for a different
one with nothing to flag it. **Look here FIRST:** diff against your CURRENT main
(`git log --oneline ours/main..theirs/main`, `git merge-base` for the staleness), test-apply each
commit separately, and READ each target site on your own tree — a clean `git apply --check` proves the
context lines match, never that the change is still wanted. Treat the contributor's commit message as a
handed-down measurement taken on a different tree; here the fix's own comment pointed at a
`docs/FIELD_REPORTS.md` this tree does not have. Preserve authorship with `git commit --author=` — the
one case where the standing "author field is pelmentor" rule does not apply, as `docs/CREDITS.md`
itself states. [[lesson-a-forks-fix-is-verified-commit-by-commit-against-your-tree]]

- **A FIX IN THE TREE IS NOT A FIX IN THE FIELD.** 2026-08-31. `docs/security/TRACKER.md` A59 had
  read **MITIGATED** for two days — *"the relay now challenges every registrant"* — and every word
  was true **of the repository**. `[V]` the DEPLOYED relay binary dated from 2026-07-20 (six weeks
  older than the fix) and `python tools/sig_gate.py --remote <relay> --plaintext` returned
  **FAIL C: it does not challenge at all**, so in production A59 was exactly as open as the day it
  was found — and worse, since b145 the client **fails closed** on an unchallenging relay, so the
  shipped code and the deployed relay were in a state where *neither* worked. The failure is
  invisible from inside the repo: `git log` shows the fix, the unit tests pass, and the drill passes
  **against a locally built relay, which is the same source**. *Look FIRST:* any finding whose fix
  lives on a server owes **two** states in two columns — `fixed-in-source <sha>` and
  `running-in-field <date> <evidence>`; if the row cannot express the second, the row's FORMAT is the
  defect. Before writing MITIGATED/CLOSED on anything server-side, run the remote arm — and if the
  instrument has only a local arm, that is the finding. `ls -la` on the deployed binary against the
  fix commit's date costs ten seconds and caught this. Corollary: a hardening that fails closed makes
  its own redeploy **BLOCKING**, which `docs/RELEASE.md` step 0 already knew while the tracker row
  did not. **RESOLVED the same day (`f4e3ed2c`, cutover on the user's instruction) — and the
  resolution taught two more things.** (1) **THE DIFFERENTIAL IS THE EVIDENCE, NOT THE AFTER-READING:**
  a staged `PASS 14/14` from hours earlier, on a binary byte-identical to the one installed, proves
  something about a FILE and nothing about a DEPLOYMENT; what settles it is `FAIL C` on the old binary
  and `PASS 14/14` on the new one, same instrument/tunnel/token, minutes apart — so **take the BEFORE
  arm before you swap**, or you are left arguing from a hash. (2) **A LONG REGISTER STATES ONE FACT IN
  SEVERAL PLACES, IN SEVERAL WORDINGS:** reconciling the tracker I corrected A2's *"pending the master
  REDEPLOY"* and considered the row done; a later grep found *"the master half is UNDEPLOYED"* — a
  different sentence, same fact, **same row**. Grep the CLAIM in every phrasing across the whole file;

- **A RELATIVE PATHSPEC RESOLVES AGAINST A CWD YOU DID NOT SET.** 2026-08-31. I concluded the whole
  `coop-server-rs` crate — the master server I was about to deploy — was untracked, on four
  corroborating readings: `git ls-files tools/coop-server-rs` → 0, twice, in two different shells;
  `git ls-tree -r HEAD -- <path>` → nothing; and `git check-ignore -v` naming a matching `bin/` rule.
  All false. The shell cwd had drifted **into** the crate (an earlier `cd x && ...`), so every
  relative pathspec resolved to `tools/coop-server-rs/tools/coop-server-rs`. It survived four checks
  because **git prints NOTHING for a pathspec matching nothing** — byte-identical to "tracked nothing
  here", with no "no such path" error — while a *tree-ish* argument (`HEAD:tools/...`) resolves from
  the repo root, so `cat-file -p` worked and read as an inconsistency in git rather than a clue about
  me; and `check-ignore` was TRUE but irrelevant (a file can be both ignored and tracked). The only
  tell was one warning naming the doubled path, on the fifth command. *Look FIRST:* when git says a
  path has nothing in it, **print `pwd` before believing it**; prefer `git -C <root>` or absolute
  pathspecs in any command whose ANSWER IS AN ABSENCE (presence is self-validating, absence is not);
  never `cd x && ...` in a tool call here, because the cwd persists across calls and surfaces in an
  unrelated one later. Verify a "not tracked / missing / not built" conclusion from the other
  direction — `git log --stat` on the commit that should have touched it cannot be fooled by cwd.

- **CHANGING A DEFAULT DOES NOT REACH A STORED VALUE — and the people who stored it ARE the affected
  population.** 2026-09-01, the same shape twice in one session in two unrelated subsystems.
  (1) `browser.lastdirect` defaulted to a dead port; the fix corrected the default, but the row is
  PERSISTED and the ImGui browser writes it on `IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit`, which fires on **focus
  loss with nothing typed** — so clicking the box once burns it in. `[V]` this repo's own HOST install
  still read `127.0.0.1:7777` after the default was fixed. (2) `install-ue4ss.ps1` moved to a faster
  UE4SS build but extracted only when `UE4SS.dll` was ABSENT and merely WARNED on a wrong build — so
  the pin reached nobody who already had UE4SS, and the four dev copies had been moved BY HAND, which
  is what hid it. Both fixes were complete-looking, built clean, and inert. *Look FIRST:* after
  changing any default ask **"can this be stored, and by whom?"** — if yes, the change is half a fix,
  and the other half is a one-shot exact-match MIGRATION or a mismatch TRIGGER that ACTS. A warning
  where an action belongs is the RULE-1 crutch: the detection was already the whole cost. And
  verifying on a rig you configured by hand verifies the one machine that cannot show the defect.

- **PYTHON `shell=True` ON WINDOWS RUNS `cmd.exe`, NOT GIT BASH -- AND A VERIFIER THAT IGNORES THE EXIT CODE VERIFIES NOTHING** (2026-09-02, `tools/qf/ledger.py`'s first real round: a `find | xargs grep -L | wc -l = 101` anchor exited 255 with no output under `cmd.exe` and was recorded VERIFIED; two more first-use defects the same day -- a path:line inside a command anchor won the classification, and `tail` was not an allowed command). *Look FIRST:* `["bash","-lc",cmd]` via `shutil.which("bash")`, parse the FIRST `= N`, treat exit not in {0,1} with empty output as failure, and drill with a PIPELINE. Fixed `7679edab` + `77268a7b`. [[lesson-python-shell-true-on-windows-runs-cmd-not-git-bash]]
## 9. Security (threat model, trust boundaries, peer identity)

> **READING THIS FILE AS AN AGENT (`/qf` critic, auditor, reviewer): OPEN
> `docs/security/LESSONS_SECURITY.md` TOO.** It is on disk in every local clone and it holds this
> section's rows in full. A prior-art scan that stops at this stub silently loses the entire security
> corpus — peer identity, trust boundaries, the receive-boundary lessons, the authority-signature
> ones — which is exactly the class of question a critic is most useful for. Treat the two files as
> one ledger: the pairing rule (`memory/lesson_*.md` twin for every row) spans both.

**These lessons are LOCAL-ONLY as of 2026-08-24 — they live in `docs/security/LESSONS_SECURITY.md`,
which is untracked and `.gitignore`d. The file is on disk; this pointer resolves in a local clone and
does not resolve on GitHub, deliberately.**

Why this section and not the rest of the file: sections 1-8 are lessons about the ENGINE, the
architecture and how to work — publishing them costs nothing and helps anyone reading the code. This
section is different in kind. It carries reasoning about weaknesses that are **still open** (peer
authentication being the standing one), and it cites the finding register by ID and by code location.
That is the same shape as the register itself, which left the public tree on 2026-08-23 — so keeping
its digest public was an inconsistency, not a decision.

The split is deliberate about what it does NOT claim: nothing here is secret, the repo's history is
not rewritten, and removing a map does not close a hole. The public statement of what Multivoid does
and does not protect is the root **`SECURITY.md`**, and that is the right place to send anyone asking.

Lessons about a SHIPPED fix are still fine to state publicly and several do appear in sections 1-8 —
attribution of a closed finding reveals nothing. What moved is the live-weakness reasoning.
